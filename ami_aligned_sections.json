        "transcript": " like you've already produced a PowerPoint. not actually what have some work. Attention. Okay. Right. Well, it's the kickoff meeting for our project. And this is just what we're going to be doing over the next 25 minutes. So, first of all, just to kind of make sure that we all know each other. I'm Laura and I'm the project manager. Great. Do you want to introduce yourself again? I'm David and I'm supposed to be a industrial designer. Okay. I'm Andrew and I'm a marketing expert. I'm Greg and I'm a hugeurante-face. Great. Okay. So we're designing a new remote control. And, oh, I have to record he's here actually. So, that's David, Andrew and Craig as much. And you all arrive, don't tell me. Yes, we're designing a new remote control. As you can see, it's supposed to be original trendy and user friendly. So, that's kind of our brief that we are. And so, there are three different stages to the design. I'm already sure what you guys have already received in your emails. What did you get? I just got the project announcement. I'm just going to be designing a new remote control. Yeah, that's that. So, everybody got, okay. So, we're going to have like individual work and then a meeting about it. And repeat that process three times. And at this point, you get to try out the whiteboard over there. So, you get to draw your favorite animal and sum up your favorite characteristics of it. So, who would like to go first? I don't go first. Very good. All right. So, this one here, right? Okay. All right. My favorite animal is like... How big of a go? The favorite characteristics of it? Is that right? Yeah. All right. Well, basically, high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family. And, yeah, they have lots of personality and be fit in robust good health. So, this is blue, blue beagle. I say I'm a big go. Right? Lovely. Well, if my favorite animal would be a monkey. And then the small cute and furry. And when plant needs becomes real, and when they up they with them. Thank you. You can take as long as this is you like, because we haven't got an awful lot to this business. What we do, we do. Don't feel like you're in a rush anyway. I could tell you a lot more about beagles. I could too. Well, I have to get you up again. I don't know. Mine is I'm going to have to think of a spot. Impressionist. Is that a whale? Yeah. Well, I don't know. It's just the first animal I can think of to top of my head. The biggest reason is because I'm allergic to most animals. I'm allergic to animal fur. Fish was natural, right? Yeah, and I kind of like wheels. I'm coming in the middle of it. Everything inside. And if I'm harmless and mild and interesting. Okay. I still don't know what I'm going to write about. Superbscatch, by the way. I was going to choose a dog as well. But I just draw a different kind of dog. My favorite animal is my dog at home. That doesn't really look like him actually. He looks more like a pig actually. I see a dog in there. Oh, that's very good of you. Now I see a rooster. What kind is it? He's a mixture of various things. And what did I put him? That's just a guess that his tail works. He's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you. Very kind of affectionate. And he's quite wee as well. So, you know, he doesn't take up too much space. And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail. This is quite amusing. Is he aware that this is his own tail? It is, I think it is. He only does it after he's had his dinner. And he just, all of a sudden, is get up and start chasing his tail. He's around the living room. Probably when he was little, he got lots of attention for doing it. It's forever been conditioned. Maybe. Where did you find this just down here? Maybe doing the next. Okay, I need to discuss the project finance. So, according to the brief, we're going to be selling this remote control for 25 euros. And we're aiming to make 50 million euros. So, we're going to be selling this one in international scale. And we don't want it to cost any more than 12-50 euros. So, 50% of the selling price. Can we just go over that again? Sure. So, basically, I don't know. Alright. So, production cost is... Oh, together. 12-50, but selling price is that wholesale or retail? Like, on the shelf? I don't know. I imagine that's a good question. I imagine it probably is, or sale, actually, because it's probably up to the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want. But I don't know. I mean, do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on highly designed at all? Yes. I think it will. And... Well, right away, I'm wondering if there's, like, the DVD players if there are zones. Oh, yeah. Regents and stuff. Freakancies or something? Yeah. Okay. As well as characters, different keypad styles and simple. Yeah. But for a work of control, do you think that would be... No. ...as a business depends on how complicated our work of control is? There's no sense when you've been designed to be a case... ...you have more complicated characters than you have in the industry and you have no money. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then the other thing international is on top of the price. I'm thinking the price might appeal to a certain market in one region, whereas in another it'll be different. Or just, like, in terms of the wealth of the country. Like, how much money people have this band on? Or just, like, basic product positioning. The 25-year-old remote control might be a big hit in London. Might not be such a big hit in Greece, you know? Yeah. I don't know how to say it's a big hit. Yeah. Market in? Yeah. Good market in the world. I should be writing all this time. Um... Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what information we're given here. Making K-Trendy probably means something other than just basic. Yeah. Something other than just standard. So I'm wondering right away, selling 25-years is that sort of that? Is this going to be like a premium product? Yeah, yeah, like how much does, you know, a remote control cost? Well, 25-year-old, I mean, that's, um... That's probably like 18 pounds or something, doesn't it? Or no, is it as much as that? 16, 17, 18 pounds. Yeah, that's it. Um... I don't know, I've never bought remote control, so I don't know how good a remote control is. I don't know how good a remote control that would get you. Yeah. Um... Yeah, I suppose it has to look kind of cool gimmicky. Um... Right. Okay. You just scoot on the head here. Okay. Um... Well, does anybody have anything to add to the finance issue at all? Do you have any other background information on, like, how that compares to other... No, actually, that would be useful, wouldn't it, if you knew, like, what your money would get you? No. Hmm. Yeah, interesting thing about discussing the production of remote control for me is that, as you point out, I just don't think remote control is being something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits. Yeah. It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something. Five minutes to end of meeting? Ooh, okay. We're a bit behind. You know what I mean? Yeah. Is there, like, how do you... I mean, one way looking at it would be, well, the people producing television sets, maybe they have to buy remote controls. Another way is maybe people who have TV sets are really fed up with their remote control, and they really want a better one or something. My parents want to buy remote controls because they got fed up by having, or if I had different remote controls, which... Right. Right. And the panel was just... How many devices is a control? Right. And the function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses. Right. So do you think that should be like a man designing a remote control? I think so. Do your satellite and your regular tally and your VCR and everything? Well, like maybe what we could use as a sort of like an example of a successful other piece of technology is pom-pilots. They're going from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras, MP3 players, telephones, everything agenda. So like, I wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market, such as the lighting in your house, or... Or even, you know, notes about what you want to watch, like you might put in there, or I want to watch that in touch and look at it. And that's a good idea. So extra functionality. And like personally for me at home, I've combined the audio, video of my television set, and my DVD player, and my CD player. So they all work actually function together, but I have different remote controls for each of them. So it's sort of ironic that they're in there. You know, they sound and everything. It's just one system. But each one's got its own little... Okay. I'm going to have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes. I'll just check with nothing else. Okay. So anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like, about remote controls they've used, what they would really like to be part of this new one. It's all... You keep losing them. You keep losing them. Okay. You get these ones where you can... If you like whistle or make really high pitched noise, they beep. Yeah. I mean, is that something we'd want to include, you think? I'm sure. Okay. I remember when the first remote control my family had was on a cable. Actually, the cable between the TV and big buttons that's on a blender or something. I get that. And I think about what they are now is better, but actually it's still kind of a massive junky thing on the table. Maybe we could think about how it could be more streamlined. Maybe like a touchscreen or something. Something like that. Or whatever would be technologically reasonable. It could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better. But that just the appeal of... It's better. I've not having, you know, these days, every... People's things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic, you know? Yeah. Nice or material. Okay. Might be. Okay. The worst exploring. Right. Well, so we just to wrap up. The next meeting is going to be in 30 minutes. So that's about 10 to 12 by my watch. So in between nine then, as the industrial designer, you're going to be working on, you know, actually working design of it. So you know, you're doing there. And for our user interface technical functions, I guess that's, you know, like what we've been talking about, what it'll actually do. And marketing executive, you know, be just thinking about what it actually, what, you know, what requirements it has to fulfill. And we'll get instructions emailed to you, I guess. Okay. And... Yeah, so it's the functional design stage is next. I guess. And... And that's the end of the meeting. So I've got the little message. A lot of seniors I thought I would. Before we wrap up, just to make sure we're all on the same page here. Do we, we're given sort of an example of a coffee machine. All right. Well, are we right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television? Or are we keeping sort of like a design commitment to television features? Okay, well, just very quickly because it's supposed to finish. No. I guess that's up to us. I mean, you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it. Okay. So, you know... In fact, they would be... Okay. Yeah. The cap there, sure. Okay. It depends on how much you can climb into that pipe. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Rye's okay. Well, that's the end of the meeting then. Thank you all for coming. Could I hit that with what they wanted to do? Isn't it? Rye? Great. How do you turn this thing off? Is it function and... Ah, there we go. It's smooth. I think if you can just leave it on maybe and then... Oh, God, this has turned itself off. I'll try to keep it in. I'll turn it in. Yeah. Beep, beep. Oh, there it is. Oh, there it is. Oh, there it is. Okay. Okay. Nice. You all very like that. Yeah. And leaving. Yeah. Okay. I think it actually looks so much easier. Okay. Are you Are you. Okay. There is. But still. Okay. We have to go. One more shot and switch. Okay. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide.

        "transcript": " Oh yes, I forgot about that. Okay. So, all right now. Okay. That's cool. Someone turned these on. Sorry? Did someone turn these on? Great. Okay, everybody, I'll start the meeting. Okay, we've got half an hour for this one. To discuss the functional design. Thanks. Already to go. Okay. So, hopefully, it was been working away. And I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder. So, I guess just to recap on what we did last time. I've gotten each other a little bit and I've got familiar with all the equipment. And started to discuss a bit about the project. You've caused why it's so much money we had to spend. And I just want to tell you that we have three new requirements. Which is the first one. Is that the company has decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is. Nobody uses teletext very much anymore. So, we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the remote control. And they've also suggested that we only use the remote control to control the television. Not the VCR or DVD or anything else. I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex, then it will affect how long it takes us to get it into production the time to market. So, we're just going to keep it simple and it will just control the TV. And the other thing was that the company wants the corporate color and slogan to be implemented in the new design. I'm not entirely sure what the corporate color is. It might be yellow because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere. And the slogan, like the actual written slogan, or just to embody the idea of the slogan? Well, that's the thing. I'm not sure. Because on the company website, what does it say? That's putting the fashion in electronics. Yeah, I mean, do they... is that something they want to actually written on? Because it's quite long. Or, yeah, just the idea that I'm not sure. Is that something we can discuss as well? So, there's the three things. It's not to worry about teletext only control the TV and incorporate the color and slogan of the company. So, is everybody okay with any of that? Or do you want me to recap, at all? That time for presentations, and he would like to go first. I'll go first. Okay, cool. All right, can I still listen to the back of your laptop? Oh, yeah, of course. Go ahead. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, the technical function design. Right, I have... I'll look on mine. I've had a look at your homepage, which is given a sense of inspiration from previous products. I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer. And I would like to ask you guys for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting. Unfortunately, we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting. I'll have a look at the existing products. I found out that it tends to come into two extremes. There's either a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons, lots of colors, very confusing. You don't know what you're doing. In that case, the labeling tends to be very bad. There's an example of how you eat the ends. I'll show you now. You see the TREM button there and there. This one's broke. Sorry, that one's broke. And that one's broke. And it doesn't really tell you what it does. I'm not sure if you had a look at the other controller now, an example. It's a very simple one. It's got only the basic functions. But the same size as the hard to use one. I'm a bit clunky. I'm very big and not very much used for active buttons. It's very hard to access the advanced functions. There's nothing, for instance, for a slow motion button. My own preference is I prefer the clunky one. It's very easy to use. But it does like the advanced functions, which I quite like having on the controls. I believe that the advanced functions you may be hidden in the drawer. I don't know if it's built out from the bottom of it. I've got few references. I'll show you how long we'll go. I would come to chat away for five minutes or so, I think. I'd most discover that anyway. A lot of what I've read and prepared for this meeting fits and re-closely with what crags just gone over. I could give you some of my preferences, but I could also add some to this, which is just about market research. But anyway. We'll stick to your area. The clunky one is the one in the right. Clunky in what sense? It's heavier, larger. I think it's supposed to be the same size, but it's got much fewer buttons. I see this as much as better. It can be. You get the idea of this size. It's a very few buttons. It's a valid point. The one on the left looks quite complicated. That PRG thing is incredibly confusing. You might prefer the simpler design, but you don't want to lose it on what it does. Maybe you get a lot of remote controls where you can open up. That's a good idea. Do we have any functions that we'd want on it? So far I've got an island off, so it's the channel up and down. The volume up and down. They're the very basic things you can use by TV. Then actual numbers for channels as well. I have a required one or a requested one. Which was that? The channels? The numbers? The numbers are the up. I would say that's required. There's no way anybody's going to buy a remote control these days, so if you can't actually individually select channels, I mean, would anybody disagree with that? What else? So don't need to worry about teletext, don't need to worry about PCR. Any kind of display controls at all? Do you think we need to worry about brightness and contrast? Essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorizing. We're saying we want this to be a product that offers all the more tricky features, but we want them to be in another area. Is that right? Is that what we're doing? We're sort of sort of eliminating things we just don't want the product to have. I think are you moving kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice? To start with, we need to find the exact what we have to have, not that we can add things if they're possible. Okay, right. Do you want to maybe just at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a function of this? So so far, just to recap, we've got volume and channel control. Volume and channel and skipped certain channels with the numbers. Right, okay. One way I would look at this, be that we approach the different controls in terms of like control types. So that for the user, it's very clear what they want to do, where they go. And also think maybe a little bit of it, what we just want to be easily accessible. For example, if we had audio controls, those could be something people set up very rarely. Maybe they're there in a little area, but covered up. Things like channel and volume are used all the time. So we just have them right out on top, very just very sort of self explanatory. So maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls. Like one which are just the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip. And others that are also available and then others that are concealed. Okay, and we're just to wrap up quickly on this little section. I don't know. Do you think maybe that's the only kind of essential requirement? And there may be just things that would be nice if it could do, would be things like audio, set up and display, set up and things like that. Maybe like a mute button. That's really saying any of the other things that are to that at all? No. Okay. Right. Okay, if we can move on to the next presentation then please. Can this reach, can this plug come across? Probably not, actually. So why don't I just pick up and pick up? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Can you go behind me? I'm all alone. I'm all alone. It's pretty complicated. I'm all alone. It's pretty nice that everything was wireless, isn't it? Okay. Right. So I can say already, I don't know whether this is for good or for bad, but there'll be a lot of kind of redundancy in the issues and the, like overlap between what you said. Oh, probably. I'm not necessarily a bad thing, but what I've already started doing is I created a slide in my presentation here. So, um, so that we kind of think what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and mine, because certainly I have a hard time separating, separating things completely. And the hard to know what you're really, where you just told me, where you've just told me impacts a lot on what, um, like market research, um, that that I've been. So how do I, how do I get this up? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Function and effort, yeah. Okay. All right. So. I see. Okay. Oh, and I see. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Again, I need to do the one about my goodness. Okay. Oh, here we go. Okay. Okay. Just before I bring this up, what I'll just say is, um, what I've, what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to, to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing, and then kind of read us in the direction of deciding, okay, what, what are our options? What should we decide? And do you know what I mean? So. Okay. Okay. Right. Can you. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. Okay. So, um, that makes sense. So, um, this is what I want to say, for example, that we're looking at how we could review it and how we could, and what kind of decisions we could take away from it. And then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things, we can think about what are our priorities. Because certainly there's lots of different information to go through. So, um, and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision, which is about fashion and electronics. And then as I say, we'd like to prioritize our design features from this. Okay. So this is what I've found here. A lot of this is new to me, so we'll just re-tool together. Users dislike the look and feel of current remote control. So if I find them ugly, most people find them ugly. The vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well. We'll see later, vast majority people would spend more money for it. Slightly more intuitive controls such as voice recognition. Okay. I'm going to look at that in a second. Most people use only a very slim portion of all the controls. So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this technology. They tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't really appeal to them. So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like for me this is sort of like three different inspirations. One is that we want something that's high tech, but we want it to seem easy. And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high tech side, we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hand. Frustrations, they get lost a lot as it came up in our last meeting. Takes time to learn how to use them. This is why I mentioned Craig was showing us some ideas that we actually try and group control. So it doesn't just look like a big panel kind of like when you look at a new computer keyboard or something that it's quite explanatory if you want audio, if you want visual, and you have those. And I will admit I don't know what RSI stands for. What headed Australian tree? Is installing remote control from the network people? No, that did not come up at all. So here's another sort of a review here of the main things I also found that most people would adults at least would pay more for voice recognition. Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology and remote control. So I don't know if that's possible. We might consider getting into it. And again here as we sort of move things starting about how we want to sell and market this. I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be. Want us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy. People additionally aren't liking the appearance of their products. So we want to think about as we take all the techy features, how we can put that into a unit which is which people like. They like aesthetics and ergonomics. So once in a year it looks good and it's easy to use big priorities. Yeah, so just looking at what Craig's ideas there sort of tell me that maybe what we want to do is try and separate the different things that we want to include in this. If we do say well we want there to be all the technology. But we try and make that almost be like optional technology. No, it's like I find a lot of TVs these days something really nice about them is if you want to just turn them on and off you can. But they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features. So we're going to grateful the different kind of types of functions together. That's what I just. But I hope here is that I'm putting out this information so we can then say okay well how do we collectively move on with it. I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends and materials and shapes and styles and then use that but not let that confine us technologically. Right. Any comments on all of that. Well one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're going to be. Who's our target audience or target market. So if we want something that looks good and it's easy to use but has is fairly powerful product whatever. Who do we really want to aim that out? Where's the money. Yeah he would have the money to spend. 25 euro is our selling price and you can imagine well I don't I'm not really sure how much that retail at but you want somebody who's not going to just use the remote that comes with their tally I suppose they're going to actually go out and buy one. So who do you think we're aiming this up. I think it will be the mid-range the high end market in terms of people because 25 euros for remote how much is that. It's about 16-17 pounds I think. Is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote for a little bit of my remote. So maybe not the high end range but maybe middle upish. I know. I don't know I guess you'd be like 10. Like a simple replacement. I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you want to go. This kind of touches on your comments David these are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of what people would pay more for a certain feature. Just give us a rough idea of where the will to spend money on TV equipment is. Mostly focused around the 25 age group. Yeah so do you think we're aiming at a fairly young market then. Is it a young professional. Yeah okay. Do you think then voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider. What do you think Craig. Well you don't see it was the adults that were in today the white recognition. It does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying. I think we are going to have to narrow it down so let's target these people and give them what they want. Because you know there needs to be some kind of selling point to it. So anybody anything to add just kind of young professionals. Like if we are going to include speech recognition it's kind of between 15 and 35. It seems to be like a really high response to that. So we could say that was our target. So it's fair to add that in. Because that's more than half a group of people who are willing to at least try to use it. Okay so 15 to 35 are fairly young. They have a bit of expandable income to spend on this sort of thing. I think perhaps that age group is significant as well. Because those are people who use the computer. Who are familiar with computers in the everyday work. I think people who are maybe both. People who are on boardish and above now would not be so dependent and rely on it. Or mobile phone or something like that. So people who are gadgeting right. Growing up used to you know in schools and universities. And going to their working life. So the not shy away from something quite high tech. That's a good point. Okay so so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition? If we can. If we can. I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now. Okay why is that? Based on what you've got everybody saying that. You want something simple. You want basic stuff. And you want something that you speak recognition might not be the simplest thing. Right. Could it be an on-off thing? Like if you want it. We can activate it and deactivate it. We can kind of lock ourselves into a particular kind of technology. So focusing on exactly what other features that we're going to say. Okay. Sure. Say speech recognition is good for this speech recognition. It's not good for this. Sure. Okay. I suggest that we think about speech recognition. Sure. It's something that can be used to fulfill our functions. Uh-huh. And then in a day we don't look at the technology. Yeah. We'll get the function first. Okay. Okay well do you want to give us your presentation and then we can. I don't mind if you need good ideas. Yeah. For presentations and then discussed, but this is a hybrid. Good to get ideas out well in the direction mine. Yeah exactly. It's something that's just occurred to me as well as if we make it, um, speech recognition, if we incorporate speech recognition, that's appealing to people maybe with a physical disability as well. Yeah. And not losing and also it helps in terms of people not losing this, you know, they saying, oh it's, I lose it in the coach. It's like we're kind of what we're sort of getting into here is making different design features together. Okay. One problem is speech recognition is, I've actually seen one of them used and the technology it was, that one wasn't picked by amazement. So you end up yelling control for our channel up. I really have seen one before. Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile to incorporate it? It could probably be quite expansive to. So I think it would be nice to have a quick perspective and an attempt to extract speech recognition. Very good. Nice. Well this is just the working design. Well this is just what, how I would go about it. I guess I try to define what we're doing now, try to define what we're trying to get done. I think in a practical way, you kind of know what it is. We've used it with familiar with it, but really we can't, if we have a narrowed down exactly what are the things we're trying to fulfill. I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are. It's changed to analogous, came from them, but in specific areas, which one of the basics are you trying to target? Are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics? I mean, the idea is to get everybody to have a design as a basic. So, you know, things that just start out going, but I guess everybody does have some ideas and I think you can use that. Okay, this finding thing is a little bit confusing, so I'll go into the diagram. It just explains how the process goes through. From the basic technology point of view, the basic steps that you need in the diagram, this like, probably works better. Okay, you need some powerful, the battery is something that you can go in. And that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last. It ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies. How far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want. Like, for example, voice recognition, that might be constrained because you might need to power a microphone or other things. That's one aspect of statement. Okay, the basic thing is, as a user interface, where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it, and blink their eyes, whatever, you know, and that takes up an input from the user. A logic, a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device and the device has to, you know, based on you push button A, so I would do something with button A to maybe button A with the power button. And then it needs to be able to send this in the device itself, which is a CVD. I think that's, you know, fit and fit with the 90Gi. It's fairly general. And I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in the way you're thinking like voice recognition, if it's something which is important, then we just add more power, rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power to, it's not that it's constrained in that sense. But these are functionally, you know, the needs, what, you know, do have to do. Okay. So I guess the rest of it, I think we should maybe want to go back to what the functions are. I think that's a good element to discussion. Well, do you want to finish up your presentation? Are you all done? Yeah. Oh, it's just putting the rest of it into words, but it's essentially something. You have a transmitter and it's loaded to it. Okay. And like on the, I mean, since we're on the topic of the technology, are there any like, what are our options? What's, what is in, is this the only way that we go about it? Are there other? Yes. These aren't technology options in that sense. This is just a basic principle of, of course, and basic components that I need it. Right. For example, if you need it, if you need it to add a voice recognition, right, then you use it in the base, with this, broken down, more components, right. You have a microphone or VR or something like that. So it's just so it's how we're kind of modularizing the whole thing. So each component represents one function. But I think the basic functions are the logic, the transmitter, and the receiver, and the power, are things that you won't have to care about. Yeah. And those are things that, based on what your user interface requires, and will add more functionality to it, there might be one other consideration which would be the transmission between the remote control and the TV, for example. Okay. Are we going to restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies and the internet? Okay. Because that's something you need to actually be physically pointing to. Okay. Right. Well, a worry that was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex, it would affect how long it took us to get this to market. So, as a suspect, it might be a good idea to restrict our kind of creative influence on this, on the user interface, and not worry so much about how we transmit it. Yeah. Because I mean, it's tried and tested and for add. It might be a little bit more of a transmission in particular, and now since we're talking about voice recognition, if somebody's going to talk to the device, you really want them to hold it to them. You may not require that, but you know, it's something very natural, I guess, to hold it, signal to the user, and push a button, maybe to start talking about it. Then you need to send a signal out. So, if you're using infrared, the line of sight, the TV's at the chair, and I'm standing in front of you, and the transmitter is here, it blocks it. So, in that sense, there's not really a restriction, but there's something you may have to think about later on in the process. Okay, that's a much better idea. And just a clarification before we finish this, is our controller, have the option of being on a standard frequency as all of the other equipment, so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment? It's a big information, but I think that one indication of infrared means that you just target an individual device. Yeah. Because infrared is something you can have. Well, in the new requirements spec, they said just a persona TV, so that's what we should do for now, I think. Something I was wondering about with the power, is it worth considering having a charging unit, as opposed to just regular batteries? I mean, is that something you really want to go into, do you think, or should we just consider running on regular batteries? Actually, from a component point of view, there's added complexity, you add cost to it, and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component, you need a docking cradle for example, put it into charge, or you need to get the user to plug it in. Okay, so most users already use the value of buying batteries and putting it into the solar panel. Unless the controller is going to consume a lot of batteries, it's going to run through batteries a month, and then I don't think you charge about something. Okay, so just stick to regular, okay, right, so busy, I'm just going to just recap what I said at the start, was that the whole point of this meeting was to absolutely finalize who we're going to aim this at, and what exactly the product's going to do. So just to recap on, are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the 15 to 35 bracket? Yeah. And also the actual functions of what it's going to do, do you want to recap on that, Craig? I think we used to say that it was going to be the most basic stuff possible. On off, up and down, down off, up and down, bottom down volume, and skip to the channel. Okay. Is it going to include any of the more advanced features? Are we going to eliminate those? I think we include new, but apart from that, I think it's just going to be a bit simpler. Okay. Is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under, like sort of under a door? Yeah, it's as optional function. What I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound, or this and that, with their controller, and then they, you know, they get ours. It doesn't have that. I don't know if that'd be a problem. And I think that you're saying about telegrizing people. Maybe I could suggest we make them by using book had it used to. Yeah. One would be audio control. One would be video control. Okay. You know, audio device. This may not match very well to advanced functionality, especially. But I think that, from a manufacturer, a point of view, a person designing the device, but I think from the point of view of a person using it, you know, a TV is something you see and something you hear. And if something they do like those things, they do like turn it on and turn it off. Yeah. So what we could have is like two buckets, two osings into like, if you want this, you can just go into there. Yeah. And then from there, the site, and it's basic, but non-based. Okay. I might help you. It would actually help you with the component. Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. Well, I've got a kind of got five minutes to wrap up now. Next thing we're doing is having lunch. Woo-hoo. And then we're going to have 30 minutes of working on the next stage. So I'll be pulling the minutes of this meeting into the project documents folder. So I guess just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next, well, in the 30 minutes after lunch anyway. For our industrial designer, you're going to be thinking about the components concept. User and Fist designer, you're going to be thinking about our user interface and marketing. You're going to be thinking about trend watching. And you'll all get specific instructions as well. So I know just to ask now if you've got anything else, you still have to buy it while we've been talking. And do you want to start with David? Anything else to say at all? No. Okay. Angie? Yeah, just, I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up, should we agree for sake of sort of clarity and when we resume that we'll use this idea, David's proposal, we think of these three sort of buckets. Yeah, yeah. I think we can discuss the best of those sort of. Okay, we're talking about this. Should we do that? Yeah. Okay. Great. Just about the three buckets. What would go in the device functions one? Things like on-off. Because they don't have anything to do with what you see. I mean, in terms of picture and the entertainment value. Okay. So in channel. In channel. Because the on-off also goes, you know, on-off like power, not on-off sound. Yeah. You don't, although you don't turn off some audio on your TV, but you might want to, you know, turn off the sound. So you want to pick up the phone and mute the device. Okay. You have a choice of putting it onto others or device. The device is basically anything we can't categorize. Okay. So you're going to have audio, which is going to be like, you know, your bass settings and actual volume. Anything to do with what you hear, right? Okay. Okay. And then visual. There's anything that you can see. Okay. So brightness, contrast, things like that. And then just actual device things like what channel you're watching, turning on and off, stuff like that. Okay. And I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the device category, there might be some which are just like the habitual standard. And then others, which are maybe a bit more random, which we can go to other places to push here. Okay. Somewhere there. I mean, even if it doesn't matter very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind. It's easy to use. I think that's one thing that, and I guess from the corner point of view, as well, because it's like, basically. Okay. Okay. So yeah, I guess just things to think about are, you know, like the fact that it's got a lit good because if you were, you know, targeting this up, something maybe kind of quirky and design, maybe make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold, you know, things like that. So I guess, I guess that's it. Right. The meeting over. Woohoo. Now we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us. Yes. You You You You",
        "abstract": "The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote. The user interface designer presented two existing products and discussed what was wrong with each product. The team discussed how to create a remote which did not include the problems present in the existing products presented by the interface specialist. The marketing expert presented consumer preferences and requirements and the team discussed who their target demographic should be and whether to include speech recognition in their product. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed various options for components and energy sources. The team then discussed features to include in the remote and what they could do to figure out how to categorize them.",

        "transcript": " to do now is decide what a fulfill what yourself is. Okay. Sure. Okay. It kind of does make sense doesn't it? Because when we get into the end of meeting, we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background. Yes, I agree. Everything I have is kind of background. Okay, we're all ready to do. We'll have it in this meeting then. If we, well, just recap on the minutes from the last meeting. We decided on our target group being 15 to 35. We decided that it was going to be normally a target battery part that we're going to group our audio, visual and other functions into these categories. And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext, ignoring everything except the TV and trying to incorporate the corporate color and slogan. Start with the last meeting. Is there anything I've ever gotten anything? No. Everything's okay. So if we have these three presentations and then if we have anything to kind of know you're going to want to discuss, maybe just make a note of it and then we'll have all the discussion at the end. I want you to have that idea this time. So if we start off with Andrew and then Craig and then Davis, is that all right? And then after that we'll have to make some decisions. I'll like stop. Yeah. Right. So I don't know how to get that. Take this. What would it be? How did we leave it with speech recognition? No, we just say we're going to try maybe incorporate it but we haven't made it up in the decision or not. All right. Or should also point out that the kind of the final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product. Okay. So that's kind of the end result. Okay. All right. So could it function F8? Uh-huh. Can you pair it in this way? Come on. I think it's working. Oh, there we go. Okay, great. So we just start now. Okay, great. So, um, let's move on. Uh-huh. Oh, where did I go? It's not good. Okay, let me just see where I find it. Okay. I think I just opened up the template. Okay. All right. So let's have a look here. Okay. So this was the method that I've taken. Basically what I want to do here before we get into it too far. I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful. Okay. And then sort of go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information and then sort of bring us all together and do it to see how this fits in with the overall vision. Um, so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarize it for us. And then I identify trends that are sort of in sync and are important to our, our, uh, project plan that we have so far and then initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sort of helps us to narrow in on aspects that will inform other, other elements of the, of the project. Does that make sense? Yeah. That sort of strategy. I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do. So that's why I suggest we get in. Okay. So out of different figures and ratings of people in general, consumers in general, the number one thing that was found was that the television remote control of a fancy looking feel. Okay. And not specify not a functional look or feel. Okay. Fancy. However, this is where we kind of have to be very, I think creative about it. Number two was that it be innovative. Okay. So that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without adding just unnecessary, sort of functional bits to it. Uh, and third priority, uh, for ease of use. So again, that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be, uh, quite user friendly while still having technology. So I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing and how we proceed with this in terms of marketing is that I think, um, what we should think about is how the, um, about how the innovation, uh, contributes to the look and feel and not so much to the functionality of it. For example, like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something, you know what I mean? Like, or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use. So how do you make innovation makes it more, more easy to use? Well, that's I guess where we're going to go with this. Okay, then there's the other aspect of the back, the market, um, research I have here is on fashion style. Okay, which as we've agreed is a priority, um, top European fashion trend, um, that I read about it says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables. Okay, especially in clothes and furniture when I first saw that I thought, hmm, well, do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it or we get right into it or we completely steer away from it. You know what I mean? Okay, okay. My feeling is that we do want to observe this trend, but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics. Um, because I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor partly something like a computer. Um, so I think we might want to be careful about how, you know, how quickly we create like our remote control in the shape of an apple or something. That would be pushing it. And then in terms of material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of might say ergonomic or friendly to handle, which is which also indicated that last year this was, this was not the case. So, um, probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode. So if we try and really capitalize on that, I think that'll be in our favor. So this is the summary of everything. Um, style is number one thing in the market of who we're selling to. Innovative design technology is also a must in that it seemed to be seen to be cutting edge, but ease of use has to be insured throughout. That was like the number three thing. And then that then their vibrant natural colors. Um, that's the way I interpreted it anyway, softness and material shape and function. And so I wrote net written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion, Mac iPods, something which is, I'd have to say very high tech 10 gigabytes, whatever. But when you hold it in your hand, there's like no buttons, you know, I'm taking however Mac iPod is sort of last years because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy. So I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it's more of like a more of like a comfortable type of more of like maybe more vibrant, friendly thing to have. And then so this is with all that information, what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we take these ideas and as we get into more, the more. Technics, sort of production side of things that we think about shape materials and themes or series that go throughout sort of like. We think of some kind of a theme that unifies it all that we agree on sort of like a marketing identity. Does that make sense? So, so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kind of get us thinking along those lines like lemon line, I don't know green colors, whatever, just. I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of what people associate them with in terms of texture shape colors, things like that. Like the ones, the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like lemon or something like that, you know, something which is like you see a lot in other areas like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon. So, you know, it's just just an idea. I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly into something which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like something to do with like lighting within it. Like, you know, just this in the simple sense when you pick up a phone and touch a button, it lights up. Usually the buttons light up. How can we build on that? Maybe like it could light up in different colors or something or people could buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something. Okay. And you know, those are, that's all I have but hopefully we can revisit those ideas when we get into. Okay. Grish. Thank you for that. Craig, do you want to plug yours in? Could you do perfect? It's probably not sending. not sending. Oh, something coming out. There it is. So, link-based concept. To research it, I have kind of come to the homepage again. It's providing with more examples of previous events and call-up controls. There's a wee bit of discussion about the existing ones there. So, I'm taking the suggestion from them, I think I'll put them into this. But then this will, for suggestions on size and size of the control and the buttons, the shape of the control, and where about the buttons should be located on the control. What I found from the research is that most of the current controls are just big bricks with lots of buttons all over them. They're not very attractive to look at. They're not very comfortable to hold. They're just holding big bricks. They're very easy to lost. They tend to be very dark colors. So, if they're shadowed places, they don't say the captures. You can't really see them. The controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent color scheme. And the standby button isn't always red, it really should be. It's something that you can identify with. This is red, which offers how it should be. I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that. I think that's what I'm talking about. So, from that, I've got a couple of references for the end control. Again, with the red color button for standby and the other examples of that. The button should be large. There should be tiny little things like you get onto mobile phones. There should be easy to press, very comfortable. One of the examples given on the home page was there's an up and down volume button. There both of them have a B on them. So, the up volume button looks like there should be a down volume button. That's kind of confusing. You should avoid things like that. If the corporate color scheme was it, we should have a very bright color so that it can be identified anywhere. Obviously, trying to avoid being tacky there, but it could find very easily with your online online idea. Do we have a corporate color scheme? I think it's yellow because the website is yellow and there's the banner at the bottom of the yellow. The Play Doh is yellow. Definitely food for thought there. I'm just keeping it. Any extra features we add, the one on the basic one should be hidden. There shouldn't be any visible without something to be open. There should be a button that's alternative. Possibly hidden in the open top section. Making something as wrong with it as we use voice. We should definitely avoid the big square block. That's just wrong. We've got an email from the research department. They've said the voice control can now talk back. We could be good to have them confirm any action you take. That's a good one. Any of the problems I've had with it? We don't know where the spoken Google is. I think it's fashion and telephones. We don't know if I can support the color scheme. You can see the corporate colors. We don't know if they're the same color scheme. We don't know if they're the same color scheme. You don't see if they're the same color scheme. We don't see if we can use any of the colors at all. Okay. Okay. Great. Lots of good information there. Yeah, that was very good. That was a good... Yeah, that was a good... It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle. I know, we had the other... It's fine. Do you want to sit in the line of sight of this? Okay, let me just get this. Oh, there it is. Oh, there it is. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I guess the same thing again, I started with something very basic. So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process. And then you can just work through it and well either modify it or start from scratch. Depending on what your needs are. The components are exactly the same. I think like what you guys said, the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface. The rest of the components, they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity. Like you said, time to market was a problem. And how many components are physically in their own cost. And the power is basically a factor of that. And the lower components, the power, the logic, the transmitter, and infrared, they affect you in terms of the size of your device. And that would have some impact on how I think more how you hold rather than the actual use using the remote control because like we said, we've defined like we only want the basic things that to be visible in the rest of them. We tried to hide. So, you know, it's just a matter of working out space. So I guess three things, cost, complexity, and the size. These are the three things that will have an impact on you. So I just go through the components. These are the options that are available to you. I'm not very sure about the voice thing because I got another email and it was quite sketchy on what the voice options are. It said it could talk to you but I never said anything about being able to listen. It said something about a sensor but I never clarified that. So maybe if you, well, I could see the other email that makes sense to you. Because they got back to me in the fight, different requirements. Or different offerings of what components available. So your basic components are buttons. And you have a wheel available like a mouse scroll wheel. There's an LCD display. I think these are quite standard things. They're standard. No. Well, in a sense that these are all the options available for you. I explained to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later. Then there's how the case actually looks. It can actually be flat or it can be curved. And then the different types of materials that you can use. I don't think you can use them in a combination. But I could check back for you but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination. I think plastic and rubber would be fine but plastic rubber and wood. I wasn't, I'm not very sure about the titanium. They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium. The rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use but the titanium had a different kind of things on the screen. So I think there is some restriction on, I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together wood and titanium. But you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one. As opposed to two. And the other components are logic chips. Again, I'll go back to the component chips. How complex or how easy the logic is. It depends on how many functions you have on the unit. And that impacts cost. I don't think the logic chip has an issue about size because they should be about the same size. Power consumption should be about the same. I think the main impact is complexity. And the other thing is the power options. The first one is the standard battery. The second one I think is more of a gimmick than actually a usable thing. It's a wind up. You know, a crank. Just by amazing. But that might be something I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources. I think whatever it is you still need a battery because I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing. Okay, the other ones are a solar power cell which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that seasons because half the year you be dead. So like what I said, you probably need like a battery and something else. And the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with there. And it's a nice sales gimmick I think from a marketing gimmick. It's a technology thing. It's a shake it. It doesn't work. Shake it. Knock it or something. You know, you know, you have you have those balls, you know, those stress balls where you bounce the ball. And it lights up and it goes, you know, that might be a gimmick combined with rubber. You know, just if you get frustrated remote control, you can throw it kind of, you know, just the. So, okay, my from my role, I don't think there are personal preferences, but role preferences. I think something comfortable to hold. Small and slim, I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable. Not so small you can't, you know, like a phone or some too small phone. And the other thing is from a production point of view. The less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit. And also the time to market and the complexity of developing, designing and debugging it. So, okay, let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions. The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features like the buttons are standard. Okay, the LCD panel in this grow wheel, you need more complicated logic. The case, okay, with a rubber case, you can't have the solar panels. Okay, with the titanium case, let me just check that. The titanium case can't be curved, it has to be square. Okay, there's no restriction on the plastic. It can't be curved. It can't be curved on the wood. So, that's, again, I don't think you can use them in a combination. Okay. Especially the titanium, I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need. So, mixing them may not be a good idea. Okay. A question on, can I ask a question? Yeah, well, yeah, it's just quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left. Okay. But yeah, ask. Can we power a light in this? Can we get a strong battery to power a light? I think we could because the LCD panel requires power and the LCD is a form of a light. So, maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery. Why, what kind of light do you want? I mean, I'm thinking it might be that for this to be a high tech thing, it's going to have to have something high tech about it. It's going to take battery power and to make that, to make that a realistic goal, I think one of the issues that will come up later is a battery power. Are you thinking of a light in the sense of light or light in the sense of? It glows kind of, like a Frankenstein. It's a light. I'm thinking along the lines of you're in the dark watching a DVD, then you find the thing in the dark and you go like this. And that's what everybody does. Always the volume button in the dark. And you just touch it or you just pick it up and it lights up or something. Like a phone. Yeah, like a flashlight. Okay. Whereas with phones, people charge them once a week. Yeah. We're going to need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their remote control every few days. That's why I think the option of the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch. But people are going to want to shake their movie control. It's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it. So you could trigger that to a light. Like I said, the bouncing ball thing or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to. So when they pick it up right and then that sort of triggers. Right. Okay. Well, let's just go back to the marketing ideas for a start. And it's giving an idea on the time we've got about 15 minutes to play with at most. Okay. So just to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an absolute decision on the concepts of the product. So back to your idea about incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg and the corporate color and things like that. I mean, what does everybody think about? Does anybody have any ideas about how we can fit all that in together? I mean, that's kind of the user interface type of thing. What are your thoughts on that? I have to go for a, maybe not a lot of the ship. The very sort of curvy type ship. You can have the same type of texture and color as stuff. So maybe are we thinking something that like could sit in your hand comfortably or you told on to comfortably or. I'm supposed to sit in your hand comfortably. This is something quite curvy. Okay. Right. Okay. Color wise. I mean, you may have, if you're kind of remembered, you may have to point about how if you have a nice bright color, you'll not lose it. Is that? You might have to need that. About how if you have a bright color, you'll not lose it so much. Yeah. And when the corporate color is yellow, I mean, maybe we could think about about the color of the whole product being yellow, I don't know. And then obviously the materials. But as anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what might work. Well, I mean, I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts. And if we think that what we are, what our number one marketing motive is the look and feel. So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sort of bits and pieces of concept and technology or whatever or fashion, then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sort of can visualize. Maybe what we could do is think about a concept which touches back to the color, the company color, yellow. I mean, if we think of something like I was saying also lime and lemon, you know, what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series. We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things. Right. Zero particular shape that you're interested in like this marketing ever in research on. Does it need to be long? I think it's circular and shape or yeah, because that will help narrow down the choice of. Yeah, choice of material. I was kind of thinking about as well, you know how you get these shop-resistant mobile phones and they're plastic, but they also like rubber on the outside. It kind of feels kind of warmer to the touch feels more comfortable. I mean, we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it and then then we could have curved shapes because what are titanium yet it's going to have to be boxy and rectangular. I think we might be moving away from that, you know, so. Do we want to in like the ship of 11 or no, I don't think we do. More just that we think about what it is we're trying to achieve. And then we have one sort of theme stick with. Okay. Right. Well, so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing. Quite like a sort of snowman type here. A snowman shape. So larger bits, it's your hand. And then you've got the other bulb at the top for just any elephant can meet. That's quite a distinct shape. So yeah, should we go with that? Can we, yeah, like to and what? Like do you have a? Do you want to draw it on the board? Yeah, just a little bit of line. So I'm about to go up and you got to go inside. Okay. I think it's. You have one which was about there. Okay. So collect the snowman ship. Trade more. That's cool. And I mean, color wise, which is everything. I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere. And do you want the whole thing yellow? We make yellow and white. Do you want something? I think it's quite nice of just that this around here, they start background yellow. And then I have a nice pooled color for the buttons. Okay. And also, I mean, how are we going to incorporate this slogan in the fact that it talks to you? I mean, it might be quite cool if when you first start using it, it says, what is it putting fashion until it's on something? I don't know. Or when you like, if you turn it off or something. If it can speak, if you could actually say this slogan might be a bit more powerful than just having written it somewhere. Any thoughts on that at all? I think that probably scared me. Turn on your piece of the book. I know. I mean, if you also, like, where if we wanted to incorporate an LCD display, where we would put that, we would put that on the inside. Do we need an LCD display? What's the functionality of it? It's buying to increase the cost of it a lot. Yeah, but the question is, what are we using it? What would we achieve from it? Putting in lights is cheap, but putting in LCD panel just making glow is... When you mention LCDs, I don't know what that would be about. And the thing I could see it helping with, if it was somehow connected with listings. So as you scroll through, because we said we might have a jog dial, as you scroll through your stations, you can actually tell us what it is. I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it. So it's a bit nuts to get the user to... One day, Tuesday, Wednesday. So no need for an LCD display? I'm not saying there's no need for an LCD display, but... What would it tell the user? Because the LCD tends to be an output as opposed to an input. So there's a remote control need to talk back to the user. We have the option of the speaker as well. So the same thing goes for the speaker. Is there a need for a remote controller? Why don't I? There is really a... Talk back. I would say no need for a talk back. Does anybody disagree with that? You could put a game on it. Easy. When the TV dies, you can play with the remote control. Right, so you're going to have these three different sets of functionalities. Do you want to group them into the head of the new man? Bolly, the new man inside of the new man? Is that what you're thinking? Well, I think the advanced ones, the ones you don't usually use, can be hidden inside. I think they're the three good, three hard, or fairly basic ones that have to go on there. They're fun somewhere. Okay. Right. What else do you need to talk back to? Where would you physically position the buttons? I think that that has some impact on many things. Maybe you want to draw into that. So I'm just going to pop this in here because I have a slide about decision making. Yep. I tried for it on the right. Oh, go over the five minutes. Okay. Back of you. Energy. Do you think that suggesting we're harrering a thing? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the backup of the battery, but have kinetic power. I've had kinetic things before and the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it. No, like I said, we have a watch as hybrid kind of thing. So it's not going to charge the battery. Right. It's just. Okay. I mean, just it's just worth pointing out because like I've known, I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time. And it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery. I also know people to have things like like a jewelry watch they wear from time to time. They eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time. Look, remote control is similar. You're way on vacation. I don't know. Whatever. Something. And it just starts to get worn down. For the space that if you're if you're away and you're not using it, then you're not using any power either. So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over. I'm really sorry. We're going to have to wrap up quite quickly. I don't know as much time as I thought. So I think that's what energy is referring to here. Chip on print. Is that that's an industrial design thing? Is that David? Yes. Okay. As for the case, kind of discuss that. And this size here, I'd suggest this be small. Yeah. And we're going to have like rubber buttons that feel kind of. Okay. And just a lot of. I mean, one of the things running through my mind right now, I realize we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made. But we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low tech rubber buttons, plastic frame. It's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there. Should we think about how we are actually getting this high tech user friendly? Like what is it that we're using to achieve those goals? Something that's like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that. Or even a clearer case. Yeah. A glowing yellow type case where the yellow showble, but in the dark, it's sort of. It's a lie. So it's slightly transparent. So it's yellow like tinted yellow, but you can maybe see through it. Or there might be a light running through like a mouse. Sure. You know, you have colors, mice, and they don't need that much power. Yeah. So the battery in that sense, we have one or two strategically placed lights. Sure. That sort of. Yeah, they emanate a light. Yeah, but because the case is transparent, so it gives it a little bit of a glow. And then the other thing that we were. We've committed ourselves achieving a simplicity. And so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like some kind of an innovative concept about how the volume and the channels are controlled? Because that's the main thing people want to do. Could we use like a jog dial, like a nice to sort of round somewhere on it where you just roll it? The question is when you're rolling it, how do you want to roll it? Do you want them to roll it like that? Do you want them to roll it like that? Because in a mouse, your hands in a position to roll it. Whereas the other thing about having a jog dial this way, it tends to get moved accidentally. Mm-hmm. But why do you do it like a mouse? You could do that, couldn't you? If you're hooting it in your hand. That's a very unnatural motion to, yeah. Okay. Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot? We might work for volume. Yeah. And maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that. But not for channels, right? If you have a telewisp box, you've got like, you don't have to buy all the channels. You've got a 50 channels. You imagine trying to... Okay. And I don't think having that, you know, too quick, too slow, okay? It's confusing to the... I don't know. For skipping watch, watch my channel, she used to have to skip the channel button. Yeah. But users tend to want to use that and once they lose out and they use it, experience it like... Okay. Because that becomes the most accessible... But that's not a bad thing, is it? Just. Because if you think about it, the alternative is to go push the button. Yeah. Jog dials are much easier than that. Okay. Right. Well, we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a Jog dial in nice and quickly. I will afford them actually. I think they're quite unique, very quick to use. So, does anybody oppose the idea of incorporating one into the design at all? No. And the other thing was, can we think of anyway getting the slogan into this thing? Yeah. I mean, if we keep coming back to this board here, I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea. Imagine that, I don't know, that it's within the shape of the hand, it's quite small. Oh, okay. I don't know. We really got to wrap up. Yeah. Yeah. It's small. And then we've got like the slogan somewhere like on the casing, beside. Okay. Well, if we can do that, great. Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean, isn't that what we just said, said we just have to decide now? Yeah. Let's try and get the slogan on there. And then I can just spend the shape of the... And then like a joggedile somewhere that fits in with the shape of it. Like, I don't know, like, here in with... That might have one problem in terms of... In terms of whether you're left-handed or you're right-handed, you might be locking yourself in. Or maybe just fitting in like down the middle here. Okay. Can I just jump in and suggest something about that? I'm really going to have to hurry on here because we're actually over time. Is there anything anybody's unsure about just for enclosing? I'm just... The next meeting is going to be in 30 minutes. And so you can see in the screen here what each of you are going to hopefully be doing. And I know that the designers are going to be working with PlayDoh and that. So, that'll be... That'll be good. And I'll get the minutes to have the scene as possible. Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to? Everybody kind of happy about what they're going to be doing? I think one thing would be the joggedile. Because that's going to have quite a big impact on the same joggeile. You know it just after you do that? What if it was flat and you just... That's what I was thinking. That would be great. A slide. Because then you don't have to put the hand. I think incorporating your logo is quite straightforward. There's lots of space for it. That's kind of a design thing that you guys can just... But it's also a marketing and a function. Okay. And materials we sort of said we do plastic and rubber to make it. And I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons. Because that'll just be so standard. Do we have something flush with the case? Something a bit more flush. Okay. And maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well. Okay. So that it has... And also plastic I've seen can get really textured. So you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand. Okay. They feel kind of like... You get better sound than that. You'd think that they were rubber, but they're not. They're actually just plastic that's textured. Kind of a little bit like that. I'm going to have to call this two layers because they're away every time. So that's really good. I feel like we've had so much to talk about. There's pretty much run out of time today. So what can you do? And design stuff. Woo! They don't die. Yeah. Quite jealous actually. You got to choose first. No, we're kidding. Can I just swipe your power cable and don't think it matters? Okay. I'm going to pull everybody out first and then put in what needs to be left. It's you. Yeah! This is real. That's all there. Oops. I'm going to take the microphone because it's too lazy to take the microphone off again. Cool.",
        "abstract": "The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports, stressing the need for a product that has a fancy look and feel, is technologically innovative, is easy to use, and incorporates some aspect of fruit and vegetables in its design. The interface specialist presented research on the appearance of current remotes, concluding that current remotes are generally unappealing in terms of look and usability. The interface specialist presented ideas on how to remedy the unappealing aspects of current remotes in the team's design and also how to incorporate the corporate color scheme into the design. The industrial designer presented options for materials, components, and batteries and discussed the restrictions involved in using certain materials. The team then discussed options for the shape and color scheme of the remote, as well as what components, batteries, and materials to use.",
        "actions": "Some team members will design a prototype of the remote",
        "decisions": "The remote will be curvy. The remote will be shaped like a snowman. The remote will not have a talk-back function. The remote will have a jog dial. The materials used will be plastic and rubber. The case will have a soft fruit-like feel to it. The remote will not have an LCD display. The remote will have a kinetic battery. The remote will have rubber buttons.",
        "problems": "What sort of battery to use. How to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, the corporate color, and soft materials into the remote. What shape the remote should be. Whether the remote should have a talk-back function. Whether to have an LCD display on the remote. What the case will look like. Whether to include a jog dial on the remote."

        "transcript": " Okay, we're all set. Right, well this is the final detail design meeting. We're going to discuss the look and fill design, the easier interface design, and we're going to evaluate the product. And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of the remote control, like, absolute final decision. And then I'm going to have to specify the final design in the final report. So just from last time to recap, we're going to have a snooman shaped remote control with no LCD display, no need for torque back. It was hopefully going to be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons, maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal LEDs to shine through the casing, hopefully a job dial and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well. Anything I missed? Okay, so if you want to present your approach to type, go ahead. That's it, Ninja Homo made in Japan. There are future engines made, well look at the expansion, it's going to be quite a lot expensive to have open up now what's the buttons and stuff inside. So instead of this is going to be an LCD screen, just a very, very basic one, very small, with access to the menu through the scroll wheel and confirm button. Okay, parking light is pretty much the same for the last time. And there isn't, it doesn't open up to the advanced functions. So the advanced functions are still hidden from you, but they're hidden in this internet, they're not in use. Where are they? They're in the LCD panel in the junk dial. Ah, right. Okay, so what kind of thing is going to be? The LCD panel just displays functionally what you're doing. If you're using an advanced function, right? Like brightness, contrast, whatever. It would just say, you know, it's like, it only has four columns, it's a very simple LCD, like, or as many, the minimum amount we need that the usual automatically know, this is brightness, or this is contrast. It might even be one a bit more complex LCD panel, with pictures like maybe the sun, or, you know, the symbols of the virus. All right, okay. And what is this here? That's a number pad. Okay, so the number pad is... Where are we going to have this slogan? Just like, or along the side. Yeah. Okay, cool. You have this space here, and then you have this thing on the side as well. Or at the bottom. The slogans are usually quite small, right? They're not, like, huge. So, there's... Say a bunch about... Say a bunch about this size, right? So you would still have plenty of space for a slogan? So if this isn't to scale, what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here? Well, I want the buttons to be big enough to push easily with the fingers. So we're reckon that would be about the same size as the pamiarant. Yeah, so that would be about a centimeter for a button. So 1, 2, 3, 4 centimeters plus maybe half. Look, 5, 9 and total. 6, 7, 8. But yeah, 9, so that sounds good. 10 centimeters. That would be good. So 10 centimeters in height, okay. That would be good. In fact, a pen is about 10 centimeters usually. So that would be... That sounds like a really good sign. You see it there. That's great, and it's very bright as well. So... Is it possible... I'm just going to bring the idea of colors. Are these the colors that have production? Is this just what we had available? We're going to have again the foggy yellow and last name that's up when you... ...repeat the button, right? Okay, so you could just list all the things that it does. So I can write them in the report. It's fun. Because it's red, it's very... ...we're going to use it as... ...it's going to be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds. I'll send it on by signal. Apart from that, it's going to be used as a confirm button for the LCD screen. Okay. And you use this as a joke though. Okay, so that's like an okay button. Oh, we've discussed how high it is, but how wide is it? Okay. How high is it? No, as in the height. But what about the width? So the depth of the actual width. About three and a half. Oh, is this to get an idea of scale from your... ...sharing thing there? So you can par on and off what else can you do? You can skip straight to the channel using these buttons. We're open to having the volume control here. So we've got the LCD in the job there. We'll just start with the volume. Okay, job there for volume. And what else do you do with the job there? You can use it for more advanced functions like contrast color and... ...contrast, brightness. Yeah. Anything else? It's whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions. But then I still got to impress by the... Well, as the designers, what are they? What can I TV do? Okay, things like brightness contrast. TV tuning the channels. Okay, channel tuning. What else? The various inputs. So you have a VCR, you have a knowledge input you have. Okay, excellent. Probably color sharpness. Yeah, color sharpness. A lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them. Okay, what about sign settings? Can you change any of those at all? Audio. You have your basic mid-range, your high-range. You have the bounce. Yep. Left-right bounce. Maybe even pre-programmed sound modes. Okay. The user could determine a series of sound modes. Then one could happen with the... ...when you click on that and go to that setting. Okay. Is there anything else that a public can do? That's fine, you just need to know so I can write it down. Okay. Right? I guess that's it. So we can now have a little look at the Excel sheet and price this thing and see if we need to... ...if we need to rethink anything at all. So for this first part here, par wise, have we got... Battery. ...battery. Do we have kinetic as well? No. No. Okay. Just battery. We need... That's because of call stress. Yes, yes. Okay. What about the electronics here? The bounce chip? Yes. Let me just confirm that. Yes, I think so. Okay. The case. What does it mean by single and double, do you know? I think single is a piece of one... ...or double, where it doubles this sort of thing. So we want double cars. Yes. Okay. Plastic. Is there any rubber at all in the buttons? I'm just going to have to skip the rubber. Okay. And we want to special colors, don't we? So I have to pop that. Oh no wait, how many colors have we got there? For the case itself, one color. It's one special color. It's just one color, okay? Because the case unit itself, the rest of it, come on. Okay. So interface wise, is it this third option we have? Yes. The two of them there. One. And the LC this way. Okay. And then buttons. I mean... We have two colors. We have two colors. We've got push buttons as well. Like, oh wait, so push button and integrated school. Okay. We've got one button for this thing. Because it's just one big sheet of rubber. Uh-huh. Not sure if but current. Okay. Let's just be safe and put, like say, four buttons for that one. Okay. Okay. And maybe a special color for the months, or maybe four again. Four? So why are we arriving at the number four? What is the number four come from? Because that's one button but it's the complexity of 12 buttons. Okay. Right. So we're only just estimating that, yeah, we'll be less. Okay. But these, are we wanting them and... No. No. They're just, is everything going to be plastic? Okay. So we're all quite far over. We're going to have to go. We're at 16 point eight. And... How? How are we going to achieve this high end product? Well, something has to go to the tune of 2.3 Euro. So let me see. What do we... 4.3? 4.3. Oh, yes. Sorry. 4.3. Oh, we could take it once but we can get a single curve just in those bits. Yeah. Much with that save. How much of that save? No, we save you one. So the thing could be that you could take away the LCD panel and advance trip together. Because when you do something on the TV, the TV responds and reacts as well. So the music, you look at the TV and pushing this thing so that we may not need to... So when we scroll, we need to get the TV to respond. Okay. So I think it's a technically doable thing. So what's our review suggestion and take away the LCD display? And the advance trip goes away as well. To be replaced with a regular chip. Regular chip. Okay. So what that means is that... And so we've got .3 to get rid of. And where are the four push buttons or where exactly none? The 12 buttons that you see there. 12 buttons. That's one piece of rubber, but it's going to have 12 buttons. And then you have to functionally intercept. So four is a good estimate for... Do you think? Yeah. You can't actually cut. It's like three times the number of buttons. It's 4, 8, 12. Is that one big button or is it 12 buttons? How can it be something in between? It needs to be more than one big button. Because if you open up your phone and then there's actually one button underneath, it's just that the panel itself is a single panel. Okay. So you have .3 to get rid of somewhere. Just reported. It has to be over budget. Or the colors. No, take away the colors for the buttons. Yeah, we could just go ahead. Normal color buttons. Well, do you want color differentiation here? No, that's not the button with our buttons. Oh, sorry, I didn't. The buttons only refer to the pads. Right. So... Take that off. Aww. It's back to the original. So then these just become normal color buttons. So that might be somebody are cutting the cost. Okay. Off that tissue. Um... Right. So take away that completely. Aww. And now we're under budget. So we do have .5 euro to play with if we wanted. How about with embossing the logo? Isn't that going to cost us some money? Doesn't say so. How can that bring you into our special form for the buttons? Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. Just one. Does that mean that one button has a special form? I think one button. Yeah. Okay. Well, there we go. So I'm just going to have to redraw this nice. We're not going to have the LCD anymore. We're just going to have an on the TV. We'll show you what you're doing. I don't think it's fair enough. Yeah. And so this is going to be one big thing. Um... Was the goal in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible? I mean, like profile. Sort of flat as possible. No. The atmosphere being quite deep. Yeah. Deep enough to become a bit there holding your hand. Yeah. It was being white and black. Sure. We didn't have enough play to make it. Yeah. So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to add. And you might want to add a length width and height. Right. Okay. So just to, well, to be thorough then, width wise we're looking at about what three centimeters are something. Yeah. Okay. And then so, height wise. How tall do you envisage a beam? About that beam. About two centimeters. Okay. Two is not very high at all though. This is high up. This is about two. Slightly more than two. Yeah. And by that thing. Okay. Maybe you'll put two to three. Okay. We'll say 2.5. Okay. Um, so we have it within course anyway. Um, so yeah, project evaluation is this point. Um... Right. Um... Okay. So can we close that? This is what it's the final step that's going to be. So I'm just going to have to... Yeah, that's fine. It's probably just... I don't know if it's worth getting into. But, um, just in that we want this to be stylish. Should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid? Because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that instead of taking your steps, taking your standard nine square grid, and they have it sort of stylized or in a different concept. I think that's something that's very hard to catch. Yeah. So you restrict them and look people when they try something. Sure. Okay. The look and the color is something which is cool. Yeah. I think that there's also that factor of... If it's too unfamiliar. Okay. Yeah, sure. Um, because when you put out the shape, square buttons. Yeah, a bunch shape might be a good idea to change. Okay. And then, other than positioning. Because I think positioning is, sure, we're kind of ingrained into the telephone kind of. Okay. Right? Um, so at this point, we, uh, we see, discuss how satisfied we all are with, um, with these four points, with the ring for creativity and the project, leadership and teamwork and the stuff we have around us. I guess. Um, do you want me to, um, do you want me to do my design evaluation last? Now, we're really sure what that was. The evaluation first. Yeah. The evaluation. Yeah, go for that first. I wasn't tired of sure what, uh, he was with Sweet Jane, but you, you go for it. Um, all right. So the way this works, I'm going to need to plug into PowerPoint. Okay. I'll try and do this quick as possible. Thank you. Um, I'll just go over your head if that's okay. Yeah. I don't think you need the power. So, was that? No, it's okay. It's okay. I don't need the PowerPoint. No, the power cord itself. Oh, of course. Yeah. So, yeah. I didn't want freedom, but more. I'm not saying you should have got this. So, what this is is a, uh, for us to, um, uh, use kind of like a. The idea is that I've set up a review. All of the, um, the points of discussion from the beginning and use that as a criteria of evaluation for the, um, uh, for the current design, uh, for the plan. And, uh, so we can review that. I think it's going to end up being for elementary because. So, we're not going to probably use it to change anything, but. Yeah. Okay, great. Uh, and I'm going to write up our results on the board. So, this will be a way for us to go through and decide if we're, um, to review where we stand. Okay. So, um, so, sort of bringing together two things, sort of design goals and also the market research that we had. Uh, when we rate this one is high in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low. Okay. So, these, these are the, and then we've been asked to, uh, to collectively rate this so we can do is trying to just work on a consensus system. So, we just come to an agreement. Okay. Okay. So, the first one, uh, stylish looking feel. I rate that pretty highly. Yeah, and we compared to most of it controls you see, that's pretty good. I don't know, like, six or something. Yeah. What does anybody else think? Yeah, my only reservation was that we basically went with yellow because it's a company's color. Mm-hmm. And I don't know if yellow is going to really be a hit. Mm-hmm. But. Okay. You can apply that. What do you guys think? I would say five or six. Okay. Yeah. Non-timement, right? Okay, let's go. Five then. Okay. Oh, uh, it's one to seven. Oh, yes. Sorry, then. Then I would say two or three. Three. Okay. Wait, what's the scale? One to seven. One is five. One is five. Uh, I guess, yeah, two or three. Okay. Okay. Two, five then. Okay. Um, control. High tech innovation. Well, possibly we jogged out of that. So, we had to remove a few of our features we wanted, but jogged out. I'd say it's more. Three or four maybe. Yeah, but going towards a little bit higher than. Yeah, three. Okay. Okay. Um, style reflects a fruit inspired color design. I mean, it's a color. Okay. The blue colors and don't actually represent the color except for the red one. They're just for one of a. But the yellow, I mean, it could be a yellow color. Yeah. The yellow is more representative of the color, but the button itself, the blue can be anything else. Okay. So, two. Okay. And, um, design is simple to use. Simple and features. Yeah. It's really basic. I think it is. I mean, I'd give that nearly a one. You guys think? Yeah. One. Yeah. One. That's fine. Um, soft and spongy. We achieve that. We've used mostly plastic in the end. It's going to be quite. Yeah. A bit of a compromise for price. Five. Five. That's really low. Well, that's used as plastic. Yeah, it's both. Okay. Um, yeah. Can we use an entirely rubber frame? There's an option. I mean, I probably could be. There'll be a cost more than plastic. I mean, quite. Okay. Okay. Okay. We've got it in there, haven't we? Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to have that in the side. I don't know. I'm going to have that in the side. I'm going to have that in the back. Okay. Okay. Okay. So we can say then out of a possible. Or. Yeah. Yeah. 49 with zero being highest. Yeah. 15.5. Yeah. 15.5. Yeah. 15.7. 15.5. Prices. Pretty good. Translate to something like about approximately 72% efficacy of our original goal. Right. I think because if you turn that into a hundred would be about twice that. About 31. And then invert that. So yeah. Well, you have a 69.7. Oh, right. About seven. Pretty good. Okay. That was just a little formality for us to go through. Okay. Okay. Well, 100 pound pen. Newbie, so that's on a state. The cameras did. Is that your finish? Yeah. That's me. I did have one other frame. I thought. I mean, I'm not knowing how we would deal with this information. I thought, okay. In theory, this kind of process would be but refining our design. Revisiting our original goals. It's not something I need to push through, but I thought we're thinking more about the dimensions. Sort of like more of a three-dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that. Slat. Could our design involve a series of colors that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the. I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant. I don't know. Whatever. Just some theme and we have different tones line. Green. Okay. It's just discussion. I mean, obviously we just abandoned this. I'm just thinking about what we originally said to do. Yep. Okay. Great. Are you submitting the evaluation criteria? Or am I? I don't know what your instructions are. I think they've recorded it. I haven't been asked to submit it yet. Okay. I was wondering if I need to be in the minutes because if you're submitting it anyway. I will. Okay. Great. Thank you. Great. Right. Well, next up then because we've done finance is the project evaluation. I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the thing. Oh, anything. So I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well. Just in case you're wondering. You're still playing with the Play-Doh. That's right. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Do you want to just individually say you think about what we're doing? I think that's right. Okay. All right. Okay. Well, do you want to just individually say you think about what these four points and not those four points, my four points. You got a different. Okay. I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips. Yeah. That's really quick. Right. Okay. Yeah. Here we are. I don't know what we'll do this alphabetically. And to the start. Sure. So what is it you're asking of me now? I don't know. And your opinion on those four points really and how are we? Sort of our work on setting this up. Yeah. Well, okay. I'll just go through your system. The room is very institutional. But the main thing is, I think, our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and would probably help to have sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion. You know, as in other words, this room is sort of a center point of creativity. Whereas in reality, as we've gone through this, it's not really a center point of creativity. It's more just a. Would you feel though that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into this? Yeah, yeah. But that's just the thing is the question in terms of the first point there, the room. The fields of the creativity goes on and we leave and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then. I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room. I think it means like, you know, right, right, all right. Yeah. All right. I just looked up and thought, okay, wait for digital pens, the room. No, of course. Well, I do know, do they, I think it means, I think it means did you do you were able to give creative input? Yeah, I, okay. Yeah, answering the question in those terms. I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this, but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of, okay, fashion trends, they're for in vegetable color scheme, but then we're told to use company company colors. So what do we do? We're told to think in terms of style and looking for you and technology, but build something for 12 and a half pounds. Okay. So actually the creativity was more of like a sort of a formality than. I feel like caged within. Yeah, whatever. It's like a balloon in a cage. You can go so big if not hit the side. I'm sure actually let's take each point and everybody discuss that. I think so still on the topic of room for creativity. Next up is great. I agree with his point. It's quite like fun to go through and then you have to start at the end and go right, go out and play out, because we don't have enough money. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings. So time is also a very strong factor in structure. Because for brainstorming meeting, you want a structure that allows you to allow ideas to get tossed, to be evaluated and to be reviewed and to get feedback and come back. And I guess that point about the room not being very friendly to that. I think that's a very big thing. And I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts. I feel it because I wear my glasses right. But that irritates me. It does actually affect whether you feel comfortable to communicate. I feel I'm hiding behind the equipment. Rather than the equipment is helping me. So you think I'm more relaxed atmosphere? It would be more kind of curious to see the atmosphere. Not so much an atmosphere is very relaxed, but the atmosphere creates boundaries to that. And the time given also restricts. For you. What about leadership? I don't know if I think I did a good job or something. I don't really know. I mean, my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction and encouragement. So I'm like your personal coach, personal stuff like that. Yeah, from in you as well. I think team leader. Yeah, I think it's good. I mean, my personal views on leadership is that effective. Effective leadership sort of gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation. But then come back to something that they take great ownership and innovative thought with. In reality, I think here the different elements of leadership, such as the original briefing and then the personal coach and then you know having having you with the meeting agenda is actually quite quite a quite a confining framework to work with. And so it is leadership, also the point of sort of disempowering the team member. But it's not bad leadership. It's just sort of fairly strong. It turns the individual into more of like a sort of predetermined mechanism as opposed to it. So maybe it would be able to control it or. Yeah, I think controlling is not the right word. The interaction is very structured. I think structures are what you're saying that each individual is structured to one particular task. And one, rather than controlling, I don't mean as a sense of control because our decisions have been made in terms of a consensus. We go around and we think about it. But that process actually says you have to do it in a certain way. Okay. It doesn't tell you, you know, sometimes you might want to be a bit more creative in terms of the process. Yeah, not that. Okay. What about teamwork? Does it work? That was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting. If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them, I would have been out of all you. Okay. I think you tried to use the common share folder to communicate. But it just comes back to us so slow in the email. It doesn't have a messenger. Did you guys get the email I sent you? Yeah, I was wondering if that got there. Okay. So to summarize the teamwork issue, saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting, you know, just like quick questions, quick thoughts, whatever, it probably would be... I think the tools that they were given, the tools that they were given to us are fancy. They don't support collaboration. I think that's the work. They don't support the team working together. Yeah. I mean, they're still very individual tools. Yeah. I mean, sort of taking upon that idea, the way I see this is that it's the structure in which we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the principle of teamwork. Because the tasks were sort of divided. And then the work went on in isolation. I don't know what you guys did while you were together. Maybe that was a bit different. But actually, if you imagine not entirely completely same task given to us, but us said, okay, first thing we have to do is come up with, let's say, a design concept. And we sit here together and do it. Yeah. Yeah, it's just to say, okay, go off and don't talk to each other. Yeah. It actually sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork. Not that we haven't done, I think, the best we could have done. Okay. Not dissatisfied with it. Right. And I'll say, on teamwork at all? No. Okay. What about the, you know, how we use the whiteboard, the digital pens, the projector, stuff like that? Did anybody think anything was that really useful? Anything with pretty unsported? I think the whiteboard, for me, is the kind of thing I would use all the time. But it's not quite as useful as it to us as it could have been, maybe just in the way that we use it in the sense that once we have an idea out there, or while work was going on in between meetings, that could have been up on a board, you know, the post to in like, in text. And then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that. I know that people who design cars and, you know, an aviation, they quite often just have a simple like fiberglass prototype. And it's completely, you know, abstract from the final product, but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and point that point and discuss. And in a way, everybody's, as we discussed things in the, theoretically, and out of our notebooks, we're just, we're actually just each of us discussing something in each of our own minds. It wasn't until we had this year, you know, like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like, now I know what he's thinking, because I saw his book. But the whiteboard could have actually been this kind of continuing. So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process would have been a good idea? I think the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the whiteboard. And I think that that is also does. Yeah. Yeah. In those things, I think it will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the PowerPoint or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place. Yeah. You know, in the center. Yeah, because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare. Whereas I can imagine if I've been encouraged to use paintbrush, for example, or whatever, I would have actually used it. Just because that's sort of how we want to set up to you, we have that time. Okay. I think there are too many PowerPoints and the meetings. Yeah. The plugin and the plugins spent a lot of time doing that and a lot of information on the PowerPoints. I don't think, you know, you need it to actually, we could have gone through it in very verbally, especially in my slides, I felt it. Okay. You know, as opposed to having to present them. What about the digital pens? Did you find them easy enough to use? I'm not sure. Yeah. Can't keep. Agreed. Okay. Having to take it before you go off was a bit hindering as well, because you have to go through a thought and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump. I know, I think at the very start of today, I, like, who did a stuff? Didn't click note on one. Then went back and wrote one tiny thing on the another page. Then they clicked note. So I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something, but they'll have my paper anyway. And I haven't done that. But I think the pen is very intuitive. Everybody knows how to use it. You don't even have to worry. Yeah. I think the pen is good. It's about the best thing. On the topic of the technology, it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files. Yeah. It just occurred to me that they have. Yeah, we only need one computer. We only actually need one computer. Yeah. If there had been a fifth, they could have just been sitting there ready to go to home. And the computer may not be conducive to a meeting because you tend to look at your computer and want to have the urge to check something. Yeah. It's useful, but. Do you think the computer is just providing distraction and the reading? I think too many computers are just distracting. And I like to have things written down in front of me, actually. A lot of the stuff that was emailed to me, I ended up writing down there or something. So I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that. I don't know why anybody else. What else? I'm not really sure what they're looking for in the same new ideas find. I don't know, as you can think of that, anything else that would have been helpful today. That's all. The main one for me is that the process and a natural context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves. That's kind of a new idea for me is just sort of that idea. It's kind of hard to keep working forward on a team-based project when you're told you must now work away from each other. Yeah. I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on. And my experience at meetings is that they really do. And you can spend a lot of time talking about it. The only thing is when we had our meeting about the conceptual design, I thought there maybe another 15 minutes would have been useful there. I think maybe if we all have been working in the one room and they just said every hour or something, everybody make sure you just have a short meeting and then just have something written down. Just like a milestone if you like. And my mother's in having meetings. So, it's not my 5 minutes to go. Oh, there it is. Five minutes to go. Wonderful. Okay, are the courses in the budget? Yes, they are. And is the project evaluated? Yes, it is. It's a nice, elaborate. So we have Ninja, Homer. Well, apparently I write the final report. What are you guys doing, though? I don't know. Oh, wow. That is lovely. Yeah. Is that Ninja Homer? What did you call it? Ninja Homer. See, it looks like Homer Simpson. So is that just, is that the stilago or is it doing a thing? Yes, just the logo. Just the logo and then like Ninja Homer, right? Okay. The red is supposed to represent whatever else you want to print on the side of it. It's crashing technology or something. You can wear Homer. You can throw Homer when you're frustrated. No. That is cool. I'm kind of, I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber. I think that would have been nice. Yeah. Oh, well. Maybe for now I'm real reaction. Should give us more money. Oh, I didn't learn something. Play-Doh is useful. No, it is. It is. It is useful in conceptualizing, in being creative. It's like you say it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch. Yeah. You get a sense where we were playing with the play-Doh and the ideas came with the play-Doh. Did they? Rather than with everything else. You might want to write that. Yeah. Okay. I'm just feeling with the play-Doh. Yeah. Play-Doh. So I've got a few little smells. Yeah, it smells funny, doesn't it? I thought the play-Dohs are actually edible, aren't they? Yeah, let's stuff real. I think it has to be. It's just wheat. It's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives in there. So what are your summarizing words about play-Doh? It's helpful to the creative process. It engages all your senses, not just your sight, but your sense of fuel, your sense of touch, and it helps you to understand dimension as well. I think that's very helpful because it's such to pop up on a piece of paper on a computer on a board. Even with a 3D graphic thing, it still requires a lot of tangible. Yeah, tangible. That's a nice word. It becomes tangible. Tangible. Okay. I don't know if there's anything else. Nope. I need to discuss. That's about it, really. Does it still, I guess, ever more? Do we retreat to our, to continue our, I think we could probably do it here. What do you know? I'm sure that the thing will pop up any minute now. Can you turn off the microphone? Yeah, yeah, the meeting's over, then yeah. And my microphone has no signal. Which would explain why you don't get any sound. Yeah, quite because of the power, though. I think the time has to run out first to get any more instructions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty cool. I can see the talk. I can see my own boy. You ready watch? You You You You You",

The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and had to decide which features to retain or lose in order to maintain the target cost. In maintaining the target cost, the team had to lose a number of features which they originally wanted, such as a kinetic battery, an LCD display, and various color options. The team then evaluated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, technological innovation, and spongy quality. The prototype did fairly well in the evaluation. The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process.

        "transcript": " Okay, well I think we're ready to begin. Right, my name's Adnjogged, we're here because of real reaction. We have a new group. Oh, Ebenezer, Ademisoye. You like to support it? Yeah, go for it. And he said. And he said. He are. Ebenezer, and you're ruled as? I'm the marketing expert. You're the marketing expert, okay? Next we have? Tiregrammer, T-A-R-I-K, T-R-I-K. And your role in this is? Industrial designer, industrial designer. And lastly we have Dave Koch. And you're going to be the user interface. Okay. Right, this is the agenda for today's meeting. As you can see, we're opening acquaintance, told training, project plan discussion, and closing. We already got through opening and partially through acquaintance. So the reason we're here, we're going to design a new remote control, as you probably all know. The very broad overview is original, trendy, and user friendly. Of course we'll have to go into a bit more detail in that. But personally I think that the original is going to be a very key aspect of this design. There's a lot of remote controls out there anyway, so we're going to need something that's really going to set it apart. This is how today seems to be going to work. The three-k faces, as you've probably already been told, the functional contextual and the detailed design. The first one is going to be covering the user requirements spec, technical functions, working design. Second seems to be conceptual components, properties, materials. And the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far. Of course you've all got the similar emails I believe. What can I say? Every user? Do you want to draw your favourite animal? Sure. Whiteboard. Okay, I'm going to make this quick since we don't have much time. Okay. Okay, so it's not the best picture in the world. Here we have an elephant. First point begins with an E, same like a benesan. Also elephants have a very good memory, much like myself. And I can't really describe it as a human being. I'm not sure if I can describe it as a human being. But I think that's the only thing I can describe. The first point is that it's not the best picture in the world. I think elephants have a very good memory, much like myself. And I can't remember that when I used to live in Nigeria, but I think I used to have a pet elephant. So elephants are big, strong and gentle, and they have great memories. And they began to let it E, just like a benesan. Brilliantly done. Thank you. Do you like to have a shot at the artistry? It's a little bit of a... Oh, you can clip them to your belly. Oh, I think you should also have your little pal mic on as well. I see. Oh, that's good. We can clip them on. Okay. Yeah, there's this microphone as well. That's you. What do I have to put that? Just somewhere else. It's just across there. That's it. Yep. Is this what's we clip? Yeah, I'll follow you if you... There we go. You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now. I wouldn't worry too much. It's so good, mate. Yeah, destroying around here. Yeah. It's a good point. It's a good point. All right, here we have a tiger. A lot of tigers. They're big, they're biggest cats. They're a project on cats of the wild and as a kid. And it was my favorite cat just because it looks the best. This stripes orange. My dad used to talk about it. He's from Bangladesh. I used to tell him he had that. And when he was a kid. And they're just the most fervent of animals in the wild. So that's why I didn't say, and to let me read it. Excellent, thank you very much. Dave, you'd like to have a dash. The monkey. The one that I've had is a somewhat oblique reference. In fact, I have a three year old daughter who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey. Monkey's have attitude, which I think is a good thing. And from the point of view, the study of humanly luthan, they and other primates are terribly interesting. So I like monkeys. This one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most. Okay. Maybe that's what I call the best drawing in the world, but it will be for now. Also, not quite as feared as your average tiger. But cats are one of my favourite animals. They are very independent. They are snotty as hell at the best of times. And what can you say? You got all of those qualities in an animal. Right. I think we've all managed to master every whiteboard there by looking at it. So onto it. Project finance. As you can see, 12.5 euros per unit. That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware. We're hoping to sell them for 25. If we're aiming for 50 million euros, we're going to have to be selling an awful lot of them. Oh, that was a property. That was a month. So that's the month. May. Yeah. Okay. Well, 50 million. And if you're making 12.5 euros in each one, then awful lot need to be sold. Okay. Now we better actually just get on with the meat of the project. So I'm going to guess that we've all used remote controls. Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market? Well, one thing I'm aware of is that there are very high price end of the market. There's emerging markets are touch screen LCD remotes that can be programmed in much more sophisticated ways than conventional models. So you get the sort of you get you can redesign the interface to your own needs. You can program in macros and you get a much greater degree when you get these sort of three and one five normal. But you can get integration between the different. The different things that is designed to control to much greater extent. You can have one macro to turn the TV to the right channel. Get the rewind the tape and the VCR and get it to play what's this rewind, for instance. Okay. It occurs to me there might be a niche for remote that aim towards some of that sort of functionality, but using a conventional push button design. And therefore putting it into a much lower price bracket. Okay. That's true. With the price range we're looking at going for a touch screen would probably possibly be a bit. But you think again, something to control multiple units in a simple fashion. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I see you get ones that you can switch between multiple units, but something that could operate between multiple units and more integrated fashion. And ideally something into which we should have some at least limited facility for running macros. Would it be ideal for something along the lines of one on button would turn on say the video recorded the TV, maybe the sound system as well on one go. For instance, I say, or you press say the play button for the DVD player and it turns the TV on and on to the right channel as well. Okay. That sounds like a good strong idea. Any takes this. Well, I've noticed that gaming becoming quite popular with television. When I was younger we used to play games using our cable using the cable subscribe cable providers. But our remote controls get worn out really easily. And the remote controls not a great kind of keyboard. So, perhaps one that was more specialized for game playing or interactive television. They recently brought out this new remote control for people to sit their favorite channels or to record things. Instead of people entering in what time things start, you simply start a slider bar to say what time it begins and slide it over bar to say what time it ends. Do you have heard of seeing the barcode design before? It's taken out the... You don't have to be really clever to use the remote control. I think the gaming, you want some big buttons for up, down, left, and right, shoot. You want to be able to change angles and interactive television. So, you need buttons to change the television angle. The camera angles and stuff like that. Okay, well we're beginning to run out of time now. So, we've got a couple of ideas. We can... We'll have to work fast. Alright, as you can see, we've got 30 minutes until the next meeting. So, we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality. How the user interface might work. That'll be a key aspect, especially if the idea of some kind of macro facility, because you have to program it. You have to have a lot of response back, or at least some kind. And we're going to maybe try and have to figure out what the user wants. What the user wants, yes. Right, has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage? Anything you think that might have been missed so far? When you talk about gaming, do you think they should have some sort of stick on it rather than weapons? Oh, okay, that's it. Like control of games, but is that the ridiculous? I don't see why not almost everybody is probably used to a console by now, and all of them incorporate small, deep pads on them. In fact, even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well. So, it's probably an interface that most people are used to. And that could allow easy navigation users as a joystick as well. I think the other key feature that would be a good idea of building it is to make something fairly ergonomic. It fits as comfortably as possible into the hand. Of course, it also allows for the possibility of a motor of slightly unconventional attractive shape for it overall. So, small stylish and something that's just a little bit different, slightly sort of biomorphic and so on. But I would need to be just a conform for the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway. That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily. I would have hoped so anyway. Right. I'd say we finish this one up, we'll get started, I'll write up what we've kind of quickly done, and I'll get that out to everybody. Okay. Yep. Okay. Very good journey, I'll do it. As far as I'm aware, we leave the microphones here. Let's get to all the other ways and just take a laptop for us.",

        "transcript": " just put it on the desk, all I see is desktop. No, on the desktop you should find that there's a project documents link. Well, actually just there. Project documents, yeah. Yeah, that's it. If you dump it in there. What's a username? A username. What's a username and password? Sorry. Oh, okay. There we go. Excellent. Right. Hopefully that's ready to go. So, functional design meeting. We'll have to flesh out some of the stuff. We'll start with the minutes of the last meeting. Not a lot, thankfully, to say. Introduce yourselves. Discuss the possibility of a macro facility. Interact them to TV a bit more. Mentioning of barcode. Joystick for user manipulation. And ergonomics of the remote control as well. It's come to my attention the following. Teletext has come out dated due to the popular app. Popular app TV internet. Remote control should only be used for the TV due for a time to market and possibly also cost issues. Also key is the corporate image to stay recognizable. Your color and slogan, of course, is down at the bottom there. Now, just to say quickly, I would have thought that only being used for the television, the macro facility may now not be required. Or its functionality would have been of limited use to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing. If anybody disagrees, we can definitely say so. And hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everyone going. I'd like to, if it's possible, hear from our marketing expert first to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go. So I'll just load up here presentation from here if you want. Would you like to start from here? Here's the... Um, try second one maybe. Try it? Yeah, I'll say it. Yeah, okay. Oh, put up with it in my last name, I guess not. But if you want me to just cycle through it for you or... Oh, yeah, that would be fine. Okay, functional requirement by me, Ebeneza. Okay. Okay, so we did some research. We asked 100 people their opinions on remote controls. We asked some open-ended questions. Just what are your opinions on the remote control? Got a lot of responses. And we asked some very specific questions and we got a lot of good feedback. Please bear in mind this is only 100 people. So even when the groups are divided into 15 to 25, 25 to 35, there's only maybe 10 people, 15 people in each group. Okay. So we got some of the best stuff we got. Remotes are often lost. I often lose my remote control to back at the couch, some place. And even if it's not lost permanently, it takes me a few minutes to find it. Most buttons are not used anymore. Like you said, tele-tex is outdated now. I remember trying to load a DVD player recently. And there were so many buttons. It took me, I don't know, maybe 10 minutes to go through each button because you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons. You know, there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses. And if they do not very often, it takes too long to master the remote control. I've seen some remote controls that are big. So the buttons, you have to hold down more than one K at one time to do something. They're just not great to use. We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls. People do not like remote controls. Some of the good stuff we got. Between the age of 15 and 25, most people will be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software. I don't get excited, I've got more to say on that. Most people will be willing to pay for that. Most people want remote controls to be pretty. They want it to be fancy. They want it to be different. Everybody has a white remote control with black buttons and a red button and a green button. Not everybody wants that. Finally, my opinion. The voice recognition thing is cool. And voice recognition, the software, open source software, exists already. It's a bit sketchy at sometimes. But we're going to get good, always accurate results. But for a very fixed number of words, how many different words can you have for a remote control up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven? How many, you can't have that many words for a fixed vocabulary. It works quite well. I'm pretty sure people will buy it. But after a while, people may want to return it. Because if you have to say, I mean, most people use a remote control for switching to channels. And they say they do that about 98% of your time using the remote control 98% of the time for changing channels. And that's for flickering through channels. So if you have to say, if you have to do that, what would the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it. However, because the voice recognition software exists already, there's no need to spend money on research and development. But this doesn't mean the need for microphones in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion. But if we do have the voice recognition thing, there's a lot of stuff that you can get rid of. See, you get the two options. Even if you have voice recognition by itself, which I think is a bit impractical for like nighttime, if you want to be watching television, you might be quiet. Or I don't know, you have a visitor come round and the remote is only trained for you. It's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself. So you can have voice recognition and the regular remote. But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part. Then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look, because there are no restrictions on physical size or shape. It could be as fancy as you want it to be. It could be like a lollipop, something like that, something weird like that. As long as the voice recognition stuff works, that's fine. So we have the free birds, we have the design bit, we have the fancy bit, right? The voice recognition is fancy, it's cool, it's different, it's radical. And then we have an extra bit, I don't remember. So I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control? I think it's a big question. What people will be willing to wait for the period that it will take to train the remote? Because I think it will, the remote will get better over time with the same user, but for the first week or the first two weeks, are you willing to wait? Are you willing to have a bad remote control? And what if you have visitors come around? They stay the night, they want to use the TV. They can't use the remote because they speak differently to you. How do you account for regional accents and stuff like that? Will people return the remote control? I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control if they have the money. So do our audience have the money? But will they return it after a while? Because it's not as fast as pressing the button, it's not as practical. So do you think we should consider, I think it's cool? He could speak up for that, yeah? I'm sorry? If he could, he'd be up for that. Sure, I'm about to end. I think it's cool, but they definitely some considerations. Excellent, right? Here from the user interface designer, I think, might be an idea. Okay. You've got your presentation now. Is it on the... Yeah, actually, it's in the photo, yeah. Is it on the information? There was a... Whoops. Right here. Technical functions. Yeah, I started making stuff up. Feel like we're at Mimos. Okay. Okay, this is a brief run through the technical functions of the remote. The presentation is already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would be being able to control multiple devices, but there's still stuff of relevance. Okay. Press on. Yeah, I've looked at a couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles. And it wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say. So this is more of a springboard for how these could be improved on. Basically, the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance, in this case, this television set, to say you're getting off your backside. And there's two main trends in the design practice on the one hand. And this particularly relates to sort of earliest models where it was, you know, so many buttons on it, so about the size of the television set. And every possible function that the device has, the remote control controls, and most of these functions are not going to be used, it creates a rather user unfriendly interface. And in the end, there's a user-focused approach that pairs things down to just what is most likely to get used. And of course, there is a certain amount of loss of function here obviously, but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions. And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use. And for the most part, for TV remote, that would be channel control and volume. And if you are one can cooperate to control a DVD or BC Apple, into that, and there's a play pass stop, rewind, fast-forward, card, etc. My only use that we should definitely be going for a user-focused design. But the problem with a lot of the user-focused designs that are about is that they make assumptions and advance about what a given user is going to want to do most. So something that's more programmable, perhaps has the full range of functions available to it, but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want. So those are the enemy accessible through fairly minimal number of controls. I like Devonies' idea, including a joystick in that, and possibly a fairly minimal number of function buttons. You then have some sort of basic display on it, so if you're... But it changes in different modes for the device, it will tell you just exactly what each direction of the joystick is going to do or what each function button is going to do. This is actually... I'm going to start taking inspiration of games controllers, the PlayStation controller, where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with distinctive geometrical buttons. And then dependent on what you're doing with it, what games. Those functions are further specified, so it's taken, taken away from that. Right. If we could hear from our industrial engineer. Yeah, because I know. I'm still working on this stuff, I haven't got it finished. All right. I have to save. Where do I have to save? If you look in the desktop, you'll find that there's a link to the project folder or project documents. If you save it in there, we can open it up from here. And put it on there, so... Should... Are you finding it okay? Or are you just actually closing it there, I don't know where I saved it. All right, if you go to one... Whichever one of them is today, I'll just say that. All right. Okay. Right, I'm responsible for a working design. This is basically the inside going on of the remote control. So you have the energy source. You have the user interface. This is what I've seen. The sender will push the button. The chip will respond. And then the digital signal sent to the TV. So if you go to the next slide, you'll see what do we need on the user interface. Do we need many buttons? Or do we need many light bulbs that could be easier to realize which appliances are on or not? Or without taking too much power. We need more components in there to supply the power. The joystick is another thing if we're going to add that. There'll be more components to deal with that. So we need to... I don't know exactly what... Does the design of the delay of the electronic design? But obviously there'll be more details once we decide what we're putting on the user interface. Okay, so that will be decided, I guess. In the next slide... All right, yeah. If you go to the next slide, then, I just used the... It was a mess. I was just putting... I think it's a guy at the end there. So you have the energy source, obviously connected to the chip and the user interface. Obviously contains everything. If the switch turns on, interrupt bulb will contact the TV and have whatever device or DVD player. The bulb will turn on, say it's on. So do we need... On the control... Different buttons to decide are different light bulbs. It'll be easier. I don't know what we should decide on that. Okay, well... Oh, sorry. I'm interrupting the audience. No, it's fidgety. Yeah. Okay. All right. We can probably skip that. So we've had some stuff put forward. Along with the new user requirements. We've had a lot of input, I'd say so far. I hear what the marketing expert saying about voice-activated control. However, I've got a couple of worries about that. The power required and the ability to cost. It seems like for an embedded system, this could cause this issue. For example, you see that there's fairly robust services on computers via voice, IBM, do drag and dictate. But these require a lot of memory and usually state quite advanced processor requirements. Voice activation could be an interesting idea, but I think that our industrial designer would probably want some research to say that it's maybe not feasible. Okay. That's just my view right now. However, the idea of a joystick and then maybe an LCD, which has been kind of put forward so far. It's almost like having a small TV, not TV, but if you can control almost all of the functionality from this play. I don't know how much power an LCD would take, but it might be quite low. Obviously, under a mouse, just telling you what's on or... But literally... If you can imagine a display maybe slightly larger than Bose on a mobile phone. Something where you can read an environmental information, a traversing may be quite a few menus. If we maybe use the mobile phones as a good example, they usually incorporate the keypad. And then every other functionality is usually associated inside of the traversing around. That could be one possibility. And then you could have like say the common buttons, as you say, volume control, changing channels. I think the remote... The sort of default functions for the joystick could be up and down for volume-lessing-life channels. We think that people who get mixed up, like, they'd be looking at this screen, that that screen, you know, trying to get up to work and would it be the confusing? I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it. Yeah. But muscle memory is a wonderful thing. I think that size of display was about what I had in mind. Though, I would say it probably required to... Most of the mobile phones display you see these days, colour could probably kind of stick to black and white. I would simply keep the unit cast down. Colour could be a subsequent development, but cost a bit of extra money. Once everyone's got the first... Oh, colours out the last three days. That does nothing extra. That would be my feeling as well. I think we could possibly create quite useful user interface. Now, I mean, I don't... Sorry, go for it. The idea of a remote with a menu and the joystick, I think, like, if I was in a habit of buying remote controls, then I would want one. But I think we don't have a specific audience, you know? What does that target audience want me to... Me, shall we try to mark it in corner? You know what I'm saying? For whom is this intended? Everybody? I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used the mobile. And that might be just another way of saying, trying to target most people. If we were to follow that avenue, we might be... We're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone, I suppose. But that does cover a very large section of the people out there, I think that's true. I mean, I imagine as well that the actual LCD, and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well, would be for the additional functionality, which maybe doesn't get used as often. Maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it. And you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off. Up and down, it depends. I mean, maybe we have the joystick as a separate one for the other functions, and that there's just a small number of, as you were saying, buttons have already been defined. So like, we go for the nice standard, up and down, for volume control. So that literally anybody can come along, pick up the remote, and still know what to do. And they can completely ignore most of the functionality, which would be for, say, the actual owner of the TV end, who would normally use the unit. I don't know. The thing I like about the joystick is that you then basically... You can then basically put it... I mean, for TV remote alone, you could put... I mean, like I said, the main thing people do at the TV alone is the volume of the channel. You can pack all that onto a single control. But then, obviously, if you wanted to access further functions, you then get sort of menu navigation. I mean, with things like tuning in channels, you know, adjusting brightness and fiddly things that no one would be bothered with. Most TVs these days actually have menus anyway. So this would be a fairly rational way of integrating the remote with the device that's controlling. Do I know the difference? Do I have a concern about a market? If we are... I mean, most of the replacement remote market is... So for remote control rationalization, you've got 20 different devices. You want one... You want one that will do the job of all of them. If all you're replacing is one of the... However many, the most you have in your living room, you still need separate remote for everything else. I just think that... Well, this is a requirement that we have to stick to on a 3D. This isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on. So this is one of the solid ones that has to be evaded for now. So I can understand your point, and I would agree with you. But this is our design spec for now. Great to say. Does that include access to say interactive functions on digital or cable? Yeah. I would say so, yes, because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes. And that is a separate unit. I think that I would say that the design spec we've been laid with is for the television only for now. And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that. Okay, so this is the other reason. Okay, maybe we'll hear differently. So the joystick is just for differentness. The ease of manipulation of certain functions, yes. Just a thumb. Maybe then our market should be TV manufacturers from the public. So it's so that the enterprise supply with. There's that possibility, yes. However, I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that. But I might not even be the avenue for marketing it, because that might be sales, but we're not in this meeting. Is this the way I figure 12.5 euros per unit? We have to sell at least three million, like that. Not to account for the money we waste the remote that no one buys. Like if we made a perfect, if we made the very remote we made someone board it. We have to set a lot of remote controls. Is this going to be enough to sell? Well, something else that you brought up was the ability to lose a remote which, as you said, you've done that. We've probably all done. I don't know if it's a gimmick or not, but if any of you ever seen those odd little key rings, where if you whistle, it will beep and you tell you where it is. I had one of those in my brother, my dad could have beat me up, because it went off all the time accidentally. Well, the other option, of course, is that the clapping one. We was going to say clapping. Digital telephones. For example, one unit has, of course, you have to have that base unit somewhere where there's a button, but maybe it's a button that you attach to the TV. Something which, when you press that, it would beep to give its location away on the remote unit. That could be something that could be a bit. And that way, because we're attaching what would be a small button to the TV, again, say what would be a small transmitter, watch battery type scenario, I'd say, or something that if it was problems enough, you could actually even just, I don't know, power and elsewhere. That might be something that we could look into. Yeah. Yeah, it's putting a lot on your shoulders there. So I mean, that could be something that separates us a bit from marketing as well. Yeah. So to go on from here, we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote. Before we leave this meeting, we'd be best to say, this is what we're going to, this is the design we're going to try and get. This is how we're going to make ourselves look unique. Do we go for maybe a remote control, sorry, we're going to go for remote control obviously. So for a small joystick that would operate, say, changing channels up and down, and then what another button that would save it, it's now being used in maneuver around the LCD. Yeah. I just think volumes should, volume be important of the joystick, do you think? We could use savey left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume. Yeah, but we have a frequency of how what people use the remote control for most. Okay. Power is used like once per hour, channel selection is used 168 per hour. That's by far the biggest one. And then tele-text is store here. That's 14. Go and volume selection. Volume selection, yeah. The tele-text we're gambling with and we're going to say it's dead. Okay. Wave the door door. Yeah. So we, well, sorry, we could maybe even go as far as saying power button, small joystick, LCD, and then what, maybe is it one more button to save it, you're using the menu system, and the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say, okay, so we're having very, very few buttons involved. So navigation around a menu for most things. And so I would say two function buttons, we're now using the menu's button and an okay button. I mean, so something I found with joystick on mobile phones is that a lot of the time the device mistakes you've tried to move it in one direction or the other pushing down for okay. Okay. That's really irritating. The other design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are, you know, very used to using a remote control one handedly. So we need to make sure that even with the joystick, you know, something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just control. Okay. So, I'd say that sounds like a rough idea. Do we incorporate the idea of trying to locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? Yeah. I think because it's so small it might be, and I mean, if we only have like two of the buttons, it might be essential to have the habit to locate it again. Yeah. So that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the TV just so that it says, find me. And basically a small microphone on the actual unit can maybe hide it in the base. The light bulb as well, no? Sorry? So small speaker, yeah. Speaker. Speaker, sorry, yeah. Light bulb, no. To flash, no. Now you'd see it anyway. Here. We might be better with the sound possibly. Those little key rings have both. In true fact, considering the cost of an LED, you could just incorporate it anyway. Yeah. The LEDs can be surprising on bright now. Yeah. One's particularly, plus that's a nice redesign. Yeah. So by the sense that what we're suggesting so far, your design, the user interface is still quite open. You could go for quite an interest in design because we're only going to have a very few key, and you've got, you know, a small LCD joystick. I think it leaves you open to a potential wide range of shapes, something that can make it stand out slightly. If you could look into what we suggest is so far, the feasibility of a small transmitter, and such, maybe if an LCD screen requires too much power or such, if an user, what can you expect? Well, I can give you the frequency. What people, what options people use most of them. So that's going to be important in defining the software side of the interface, right? You want the stuff that are more... Yeah. If you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken where of a joystick to control the very basic functions, and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile. Okay. I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame, but it could be something we could maybe look into. Sure. Okay. Any last comments anybody would like to put forward anything that you think has been missed out? Bit of a wide open questionnaire, of course. Feel free to email me if you think that we've screwed something up and want to get it rectified as soon as possible. Okay. Yeah. So I should just look at the speaker, about the speaker and LED for locating. Transmitter. What we thought about that. If we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers, then the... And the transmitter could actually be built into the television. First of all, getting external power source, yeah, that's what it's for. And something that we can easily be adopted at the last minute as well, let's say. The electronics can be either placed externally or internally. Make sure the difference to the final product of the actual remote control. So that's good. Maybe because there's a new potential market. Yeah, I think if we get a major television manufacturer to say, oh yeah, we'll have that save us the bother. Then that's vast amounts of sales quite, quite a lot. Oh, one thing Roma has not talked about at all, my apologies for that. User interface, we also need to maybe get the slogan in here. It's... I'm pointing at my laptop, what the God. Real reaction in such. So, as long as you put the fashion in electronics, isn't it? My apologies. No, it could well be. I've probably missed that. I think that's almost the last minute thing we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top. So I'm not too concerned that we haven't gone into depth about that. But it might be something you can consider when you're thinking about shapes. In fact, we might like to put a slogan on and possibly two hours to signify the company rather than a real reaction. I thought the double arc would perhaps be the end of that. Sounds good. And I'd say for that, so it's for now. Okay.",

        "transcript": " All right, yep. Okay. So we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes. I think to sum up the last meeting with Beat is say the requirements that we've set out. Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on a small joystick LCD and a couple of other buttons for navigation with power being was supposed one of the main single purpose buttons. We were also going to use a novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter or any luck the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design. Looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control of any luck. Pretty much sums up the last one. So we'll just crack on. Like to maybe start with the industrial designer if it's possible. Okay. Today is the conceptual today. This meeting is a conceptual design phase and is. What parts might be made of? Can we outsource these from elsewhere? Well, we have to construct the items ourselves. I have a presentation area. I just said that in the. Yeah, okay. I'll just I'll load it up then. Oh, interface concept. That's you. We've got train watching. Components design. Okay. So. The case. That's what our first of all could be plastic. But later on. We can we can be rubber as well or titanium or even wood. So. We need the infrared transmitter. Get that off the shaft. Joystick will probably never going to use it. And could be. Plastic rubber even as well. And if you go on to the next slide. But if you go on to findings, it's two or three slides. So this is what our family can use. Three different types of batteries. Can either use a hand dynamo or the kinetic type ones. You know that they're using watches. So the power. Now the kinetic one. Because. Because that's the ones where like you the movement causes it. The battery for a watch wouldn't require a lot of power would be my one query. Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power? Do you think watch moves around a great deal more? I think it would. And so does I don't know that. The inside and all. Probably just use conventional batteries. And. Which is supposed as well would allow us to go off the shelf again each. These are three different types of three different types of shapes. You can have what is flat one. And then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved. The materials are there as you can see. But can't have a tiny one for a double curved. The titanium they're really strong metal. Is it also a quick sense? I don't know if you'd be able to have the top of your head or not. The single curved double curved. Would you be able to give an example? Could you maybe draw something that you don't have to be perfect. It's just because I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two. The first was thinking for sitting at the palm of your hand. Maybe like this with the joy pod here. Just secure. And maybe. And okay button around here so that the film can use it quite easily. I don't exactly double curves. The public means this is probably double curved. Whereas a single curved would be. I guess. So it might literally just be two curves. Okay. Whereas this is two curves. So I guess that's what they mean by a double curve. Which looks better than a single curved. You can't have it in titanium. Nice material. For the buttons. You can have the scroll wheel which they use in the mouse's. These are the pieces. And it requires more expensive chip to use. If you want to use LCD, it's more expensive. So you can just slide. If you want the buttons to be. Oh yeah, if you have a double curved. Control on its rover. Then you have to use rover buttons as well. Push. You're going to have to have a number keypad. Anyways, for the amount of channels these days. You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels together when you want to. You want to enter just the number if you know. So. I'm going to have to have a number keypad. Okay. Definitely something we can talk about. So you've got a little bit about the chip that we might require as well. So. Depends where. I'm going to spend the money. If you want to fancy LCD. Do you have any idea so far? When we're saying that we need an advanced chip for an LCD. Does that shoot the cost up by a drastic amount? Or. Or. I think compared to the pressing of buttons. If you press the button. It sends a certain transmission. Through the infrared, whereas something if we're controlling the LCD we definitely require a much more powerful chip. Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think. If I've not overstepped. Okay. Should I go on over. If we only have 12 pounds 50 to have euros not even 12 pounds 12 euros was that like eight pounds is not like that. Well, we'd also be relying on the the bulk buying and. I assume we have to look into the cost. So sorry. The previous slides just explain what's the internal components of the. You know, control if you don't want before that. So it just says what does. Try to take the key press into the infrared signal and this is received by TV. The chip just needs to take the key press. And then it's added to the trap the amplifier. Okay. And then the next slide shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons. Developing the buttons to get sent to the chip. So that's just how the. And it's a side on what. What is it? Okay. Here's a second. So in the information that you've been supplied how feasible would you say that the idea of using an LCD looks. I think we can do it. We use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or a kinetic. And then maybe use single curved case because you might need to be curved for the. Call to use the choice choice. And then you may be a fast chip. I mean, that sounds like quite a good requirement to me. Conventional battery would seem to make sense. I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved. And I don't know about anybody else, but. Plastic rubber as a traditional format casing would seem to be a good way forward. I'm actually going to be a golden go straight for rubber. For reason. I'll go into that. I also have a preference for. Okay. Well, um, based on my reasons. Yeah. Well, we want to use her interface and. Yeah. Sorry, as long as we use. Yeah. Okay. And. And. And. Interface concept. I'm going to have to work between the. The slides and the. Yeah. And the whiteboard because I actually have some fairly concrete things. It's time. Now, I was given an. An HTML file giving various ideas from. From other previous remote control designs and. Pretty much decided to just dump them off. I wasn't very impressed by them. And they didn't seem to read nothing I saw seem to meet the sorts of design specifications that were going for today. So what. Rather than looking at other remote. It will be better to simply look at the human hand. And try and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on. So every. So the finger is each finger or some is wherever it needs to be already. So. Next slide. Please. And what would basically decided almost the. The joystick to function buttons and the LCD is keeping it paired down to the absolute minimum. I don't actually think we need the. The numeric keypad because if you because one of the menus that we could have available. The via the LCD is one of the scroll through channels. So there's something. And bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for. It's quite a good. For digital or. Or for cable or whatever. You're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels. And then. Your V. And then the channel for your VCR and our DVD player. And our. Set top box. So it's not. I'm not really excessive. And then. Because I have two modes basic mode. Where the joystick left right left right for channels up down for volume. And the. And menu mode. For further functions. And the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is if we're going to have a high ergonomic design. It needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people. Can I jump in slightly there? That would suggest the double curve design is probably going to be most appropriate then. Yes, absolutely. Okay. Basically what I. Basically what the what the room would be having. I would say the whole thing articulated at two points. So if you're. If you're handing it from a letter left or right handed you can adjust it so that the. The LCD and the. The joystick would be in the right place. Also, this is a rather nicer design gimmick that the. The whole thing should have sort of organic feel to it. It should be. Soft to touch and can be moved around. On to the next. To the next slide. Just letting over will probably quite tight for time as well. Okay. Because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say I guess. Yeah. Okay. Basically. I can. Add pretty pictures to this. The. Assuming the hand the hand to be in a sort of this position. Um, not hold holding the remote. The, um, the joystick unit should rest over the. The joint of the four finger. So it's directly visible for the thumb. And it would need to be a. It would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around. For left or right handed users. So. You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same. The respective of hand in this. You just have big, two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can. And the upper part one for the four finger one for the middle finger. Is this the joystick? The, this part here is the joystick. This would be the actual grip probably where you don't have the battery is well. Okay. That would be probably the bulkiest part. And you then have at the, uh, at the bottom. The LCD and this would need to be articulated as well. And basically I want this to rest here right at the base of the wrist. So it would fit just nicely in the hand. And again, this part could be. Rotated so it can. So, so that it can be adjusted either left or right handed user. So the top, the top function button in basic mode would be the on-off switch. And menu mode would be the enter button. And then the bottom function button switches between, between modes. Now programming it. Actually, this is one thing I found with. The replacement remote control programming them can be a right pain. So I thought the simplest way around that would be to have a cable to connect it to computer some. Some fair, we're going to have some fairly, fairly simple software on the computer just so that you, on your phone computer, just so that you could pro program it at a rather, any rather more comfortable interface. And you could download programs for it from TVs from all of the main manufacturers. Though it would be necessary to have a, have a, have a mood for programming it without the computer. Just in case there are, there are still people left out there who don't have them yet. Yeah. Okay, that's my idea. Actually, right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So to gather my research, three basic methods, we compared whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff, but they want it to look cool. And then we, we research our fashion trends in Europe, what's, what's the new black, you know, as it grows. Next slide, please. We found the north of importance. People want the remote control to look cool more than they wanted to, to be cool. They wanted to do a lot of goods. They wanted to look like it does a lot. And if it does do a lot, that's a bonus, but they don't care so much, you know. They want it to be, that sounds a bit like a contradiction, technology, technical, technologically innovative. If you wanted to be that, but still they care more about the way it looks than what it does. So like the interface is really important. And easy to use. It just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important. I mean, the second point is twice as important as the third point. People want it. It has to be cooler than easy to use, you know, if it has the newer speeches, even if it's difficult to use to prefer it to have the newer speeches. And if it's easy to use, that's a bonus. Now this seems a bit odd to me, but fruit and bears is the new, the new black for furniture, for clothes, for shoes. Had that relates to remote control, I don't know. But I see, I'll come onto that in the next slide. Spungy, I've always been saying everything is the new black, or spongy is the new black as well. So we had the choice between rubber and plastic. If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze, you know, it's spongy, then that's good for lunch. Not the rubber material is the type of stressful material. Okay, just normal rubber. Okay, so kind of spongy material. So, okay. So my personal opinion. We want some advanced internet technologically innovative, obviously. But what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool. That's different, you know, that's everyone has a white remote control, black remote control. You need something cool. Like titanium is cool, but it's expensive. And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control. Now the fruit and veg options. Even we go in that direction, or we stay totally away from it. I mean, the research did come up with fruit and veg, so maybe it is important. It's up to them to face guy. So if we stay away from it, you know, stay away from it. But if we're going to go along with it, then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that or a kiwi fruit. There could be something like, I say potato field, but I'm sure you guys have a much cooler idea than I do. So I think cool is the key. I have a few questions about a swanji remote control. I've never seen one before. I've seen plastic remote controls. I think maybe they were, I don't know, back in the day when they first came up with remote controls, they had a reason for it being sturdy, you know, for being stronger sturdy. So if we want something stronger than sturdy, I say, stay replaceable titanium. But if we go with spongy, we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want. It doesn't matter, spongy material is not going to break, you know. I just don't know how the LED and the lights are going to fit into a spongy material because it's not going to be completely squeezable. So how do things fit in? And if we are going to use spongy, we can say it's long lasting, you know, it's damaged resistant stuff like that. So just to summarize, people want stuff that's cool, that's, that looks like it's cool. And if it is called nest of bonus, where there's nothing to be, people like fruiting veg, we can even go down that alley or stay totally away from it. People like spongy material, if we're going to use spongy material, we have to think of how practical it is and how we can further promote that idea. And also this was this year. So things change all the time every year, you know, they always talk about this year, this is a new black. Well, next year, something else is going to be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruiting veg. That's me. Well, I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway. You always have to bring out new designs. So if we can get next year than that's possibly a good place to start anyway. It seems like a lot of components could be off the shelf. So I don't know exactly what cost would be incurred. I can see your point about the numbered key back, but I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system. If you need to do traversal of a large number of channels, my feeling would be that even if later date this was to be taking control of set-top boxes as well. And these of the LCD and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be. Actually, if you've got a lot of channels, the numbered key back can be quite annoying as well because if you're trying to remember what numbers the discovery child is. That's a good point. You can go for it names. But if you have a menu structure, then you can subgroup them. Okay. You can use music. Like they do on it. It's kind of digital. Yeah. Yeah. So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components. Say something like, um, lithium ion battery, the kind that you find in most, um, small handheld devices now. Looks like we're going for a double curve design. Um, I don't know what cost implications there are in that. Um, looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber. What I'd have to say, depending on how flexible it is, we might need to have some kind of inner frame. Yeah. I would say definitely. I mean, the study of having it was articulated. There would be basically two points of articulation. One below and one above the, uh, the mains are grip. Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation? I can see why it looks appealing, but it could be a weak point in, um, the structure, do you think? That would be a woodie of mine. You're going to put in the edge saying, uh, it's like a banana. Oh, I don't think there would be a structural weakness. I mean, if you have a firm substructure, you can then incorporate your articulation into that. If you then have, as a outer skin of, um, flexible spongy rubber, then you have something that is very much, you know, organic. I think it would look rather cool. I mean, drawing there doesn't do it just as it makes it. It makes you look a little bit more like a vibrator than a, uh, then a remote control. But, uh, we went out that functionality. I wear one interesting point is I don't know how serious you were there. But if we take some of the ideas over banana, why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the, the color of the logo? Sure. Yeah. It's certainly a different color from your average, um, make it harder to lose as well. Yeah. Was there anything in your research? The noise for when you lose the banana. Yeah, for when you lose the remote control, it could be like a monkey noise or something like that rather than a standard B. You know, you lose the monkey that banana. You press a button and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana. I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable. They'll be have monkeys default. Oh, I was going to talk about the programmable remote control. Now, I think it would be cool if you had one remote control that can work with old TVs. You know, you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. But why you need to program it like a standard feature, I don't know. Well, basically, the, um, for, I mean, each manufacturer will have a particular, we'll have a particular command set that the TV responds. Yeah. It's not simply a matter of frequency. So, um, usually what's done is you have a big booklet full of different possible. You'll have all of them sort of programmed into the remote and you'll have this little booklet of codes. You then find your, um, find your manufacturer and try the different codes that come under that manufacturer's name until you find the right one. That's because televisions, they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it. Yeah, that's right. So, that's, that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that. But if we had, um, some sort of hook up into your computer as an option, then if you've got a computer, you can avoid that rather irritating. An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer, we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes, maybe we can have it for one of the options they have is it they look up the name of a company on the LCD and then maybe look up different names of, um, different actual units have been produced. Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like, does a Stu for correct function and such. Is it, is it actually a book of names to digits or is it like a few pages? Um, booklet, some pages. I just think if we were to store this information, some type of mapping, this person probably need to use this feature like once, you know, when he first buy the remote control whenever they buy a new television. So, once every, you have to be used very often. Yeah, and it's, but it's a, but it's a nuisance. And it's a nuisance very close to the, to, um, to actually purchasing it. So it's something you're likely to be thinking about. If there's one in the shop that says it can avoid much of that nuisance, you might be favorably inclined towards it. Um, okay, this is just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage. I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway. This was a conceptual one. Um, I think we've come up, I think we've covered everything we need to here. Um, I think we've decided on what, you know, decided on standard items for most of them, rubber and such. So, and we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting. So, for example, um, we'll just start at the top. You've got yourself and the industrial and designer going to be working quite closely at this stage, because it'll be hard not to, obviously. Looking for a phototyping of some of this description using clay. Um, I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as a progress. Um, the user interface design. It looks like the idea of push forward so far is maybe more of a physical one now, where it's possibly be more interested in maybe how the LCD is going to incorporate, do you think? Or do you foresee that most of the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout? Um, well, I think other than getting us more aesthetically pleasing form for it. Most of the sort of layout design decisions are, are made, I would say. But then again, the, um, the menu structure to, to consider, really stand out is going to vary according to the model of television. And also any customizations that the user might wish to incorporate. So, um, one of the nice things about having an LCD and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it. Um, okay. I got product evaluation as well. Yeah, see I don't, some of these things kind of logically follow the others. How can product evaluation doesn't come after that's been seen? Are you product prototype? I think would be, yeah, no, it would be more a case of how do you envision us performing the product evaluation once we have a. Model to test with. Oh, that's the okay. So, um, so it would be a case of, do you think that just bringing users in to have them test out? Maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places, which I suppose is quite similar. Or just kind of hitting the streets and, you know, saying, this is a new remote control. What do you think it'll look at it? Okay, so, um, um, at this stage, we still have no, no target audience. I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say, maybe 60 or something will it address? Okay. Um, the reason I'm saying that is that we're just looking at a replacement remote control, something that's stylish. So maybe you're even just, maybe you're not around down your target audience simply by saying it's thirst. If they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then they've got a bit of free cash that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket. Maybe even single just for the reasons of, um, excess cash flow. Of course, I mean at 25 years, I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the, yeah, diverse as well as in normal bracket. Your idea of the USB would, I think, would largely depend on the cost. USB is definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there, but it might push the cost of the overall unit up because we require not just the connection, but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system. That one would have to be based on the US. The US paid for which? The idea was that maybe it could connect tops for, um, allowing a software interface and the PC for a larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice eating minimal design normally. Definitely talking some type of, but didn't they just say it's just for TV? It's just for TV, but for different programming it to use your TV, you might hook it up today. I'm not sure, but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of USB might be prohibitive. We don't know unless it would make sense to. But you're going to need some type of flash memory or something, but something that doesn't, you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the bad we did change. Yeah, you know, I mean, it would need to have, it would need to have, um, some sort of onboard memory anyway. For one, one thing because I do think the menus should be, um, although, you know, it's not going to be terribly complicated. It was just controlling one device, the menu system ought to be, um, ought to be customizable and different languages and different skills. How do you want to say the, um, the menu structure for looking through channels? If you've got lots of channels. If it was customizable as in different languages and stuff that does open, it is supposed to be international, right? It would make sense to. It would make sense to. And we better be careful that the time as well. We've already had five minute warning. Um, I would say, um, international would make sense. Um, you're going to look at product evaluation. I'm like, best heart rate up hell of a lot of crap. Um, you're going to look a bit more at the kind of physical makeup, you see, and looks like we're going to need it maybe a kind of prototype in play. We'll see how that goes. We're going to be supplied with the claims. Where is the claim? So, um, I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting, would you say? Yeah. Obviously we're going with the fashion thing, like, different, which is, um, spongy, smover. Yeah, I would say that would be my, I think I would largely actually clear the whole thing. But, um, but the spongy, I like it. You seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the river of rubber could be quite. Yeah. I do, I do, I mean, having, having bright yellow on this, but the moon would have options for colors as well. Yeah. And again, it has the advantages being harder to lose. Sure. I mean, we are trying to promote a remote control, but we want to keep the company brand as well. Yeah. So we always need to remember it's somewhere women to be getting this slogan on. Possibly, I'm not sure, but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area, which could be used. Like I said before, I think we should have the RR on the, on the top function button. Okay. And I think that says it all really. I'm going to go to it. Right. We'll see everybody in a half hour.",
        "abstract": "The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer presented options for batteries, materials and shapes to use for the case, buttons, and chips. The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for an ergonomic remote which conforms to the shape and movements of the human hand, as well as an option in which users could connect their remotes to computers in order to download program settings. The marketing expert discussed findings from trendwatching reports, which indicated a need for products which look fancy, are technologically innovative, are easy to use, have a fruit and vegetable theme, and are spongy. The team then discussed what materials and components to use, the color of the remote, and programming options for the remote.",

        "transcript": " that should hopefully do her trick. Sorry about this small delay, but I got a little bit behind schedule. Okay, so just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one, we're going to go for something, how was it, the new black of a leaf? Something that looks good because that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end, but we should never avoid functionality, of course. Many of our components are going to be standard off the shelf, but it seemed like we were going to require at least an advanced chip, and we were stored very much for the idea of using an LCD display. Other things where we were hoping to use rubber, most likely going to be double curve, etc. Okay, so due to your hard work, we might as well let the two designers go first and show us the prototype. Okay, that's a quite hard way to do this, I'm not sure, but... I think we will step up and do it. Doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design. For one thing, it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for hand-inness is down here for the LED as it turned out. The whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick, so it might be an idea to be able to adjust the position of the base of the joystick just a little bit. Just a thought, you could simply have a slightly over-hoid shaped joystick, they could then just be twisted around so that the stickier is, so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other. But as you see with the holding it in the left hand, the LCD is nowhere useful. So that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain our ergonomic design. Now, I got your note about keeping the cost down. We'll go into that a bit more, but this design could be done with plastic casing, though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle, having the edge to rubber grip over that, which will allow for a slightly water biomorphic form and a bit more ergonomic as well. As for the single curve, this edge and this edge, like I said, would be nice to have some curvature to it, but it's not absolutely necessary. Really, the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the joystick rests over the edge of the hand like this. There you have the cosmetter here. No, we speak here for the remote control finder. Any further comment? Obviously it's going to be bulkier than it looks because it's going to be flattened on side. So that LCD will stick in there, I guess, because it can't get accurbed. I mean, that's cosmetter and it's plastic as well, so it'll be as cold as full on the hand. I mean, with the rubber design, it could give pretty much mold very much to the user's hand. One nice feature if we could still do the rubber. I thought it was to have the rubber extend beyond the end of the bridge of substructure. So it has a recent tail, you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely. Yeah, that's it. Okay, yeah, great. Yeah, I've got a few load up my, by the way, so yeah, okay, yeah, like I'm actually going to work. Are you values? Basically, we need to rate the prototype by. Then we will, it's a 7-step kind of evaluation process. So, not 7-step, 7-scale. So, after we finished doing all the ratings for each criteria, we averaged that. And that would give us some type of confidence in our prototype. And the criteria are based on real reactions, kind of goals, policy, marketing strategies. And also those are put together from the user requirements page. If you put the... So, those are the criteria. Perhaps I could have put them a bit better, but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned, which means that the product was scored very badly on some of those points. But it might be. So, we have them. True. 1... 7...8... Okay, so we have to go through each point. We imagine that's actually straight. And just give it a score. So, how well would you say the prototype is... How well we realise the dream of being able to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they're lost? I mean, is the homing thing still the locator? Yeah, that's still part of the design. Sure, and Adam, we can keep that in. Yeah, I believe so. So, I mean, I don't think anybody could actually stop remotes being lost, because that would mean doing something about human. Yeah, sure. But, I'd like to think that we've done something about finding damn thing once we have. Sure. And making it a bright colour helps them. But personally, I've gone for purple, no. Bright colour, so we still have that noise-bingen. On a score of 1 to 7, how would you guys rate it for finding it once it's lost? I'd say number 1. Number 1? Okay. Number 1 for the first grade to you. I think if it was just the sounder, then there's something I found with, we're saying, trying to find the Carlos Fona mobile, you can hear it, you can't quite pin it down where it is. Yeah, you can tell what the mobile is. What about the volume on TV's turned up massively? And here's one I turned down, the volume can't find the remote. Suppose you have to go to TV and... Yeah. Yeah. You wouldn't hear it at the speaker. Just before we go through all of the steps, you want to say something here. Well, what we'll do is, if we can look at the Craycure, you've been able to evaluate, and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's all right. That's fine. Yeah, that's up. That's fine. So, is there anything here that you want to do covers and the criteria that you've covered, and then we'll come back pretty much properly to this. What does it mean? Is there anything on it? Is there any of these criteria that you need any explaining or is there anything that you thought really would stand out compared to the others? A few. Some of you got neglected for my initial research is that raw reactions has a goal, strategy, that all of their products being inspired by interior fashion and clothing fashion. That is why food and veg being popular in their home and clothing was important. And they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends and fashion. So, they say we put the fashion electronics where they really mean it. They're very big on fashion. So, that's this bit right here. And this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody. I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use into this. So, we're kind of condensed into one. And we can come back to it. You said, it's okay. No, and we will do very, very shortly. Okay. Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. Most of it stems from the use of the LCD, which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure, because of course we were required to chip as well. The only way to get this down was either to ditch the LCD, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were going to interface, we would require more buttons, etc. Or what we did was that we, as an I, as quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. Changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curved design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs. And we're just scraping it in. We've got point two for you to left over there. So, we're just managing it really. Even then as well. There was no criteria technically defined for a joystick, so I've used what I think is appropriate with any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to. It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side. For example, the possibility of having the USB connection is definitely not all valuable now. Different languages. That should still be viable. We've got an advanced chip. We've got the use of the LCD. So, being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility. But, what's something we need to decide on is how we're going to go from here. We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people, if need be. We can bring the excel sheet up and show you if you wish. I really think as much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, possibly meaning that the LCD wouldn't be in this perfect place. It might be slightly between what would be good for left-handed and what would be good for right-handed person. I suppose one thing that could be done is how it's circular and how it's so that the pink... Actually, it goes a bit over the pinky finger. It very much is about making concessions, unfortunately. Do you have any data on how much different prints cost? Can you get the entire thing printed with a design? But is you mean on the plastic? I have as much information as I do. As you can see here, for example, the battery, really not very little choice in that one. We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well. Unfortunately, we require the advanced chip if we're going to do what we're needing to. I said single curved. We really do need it to be that way, and for the ergonomics of it. Plastic for some reason, in Curves No Costs, which I've had to very much make advantage of, despite the fact that Robbers only got a value of 2 euros per unit. Problem comes here, as you can see in the interface. If I've read this incorrectly, then we can say 0.5 of a euro here, and it's not per push button. That might make sense because then a numeric keypad would come in at 4.5 euros, which is an awful lot, so that could well be wrong. Even if we say 0.5 there, it would just mean it would most likely place it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit, which is up to be put to some side. As you can see, the use of an LC display, advanced chip, and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well, because it's an integrated scroll wheel push button. Wasn't quite what I think had minor joystick. Why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together? That's quite significantly expensive. I... that's something you have to take up with the bean counters. As you can see, that's taken up well over half of the price. So, very much open to suggestions of where we go, but because we need to shed what was for use off of the price of what we really desired. This one comes in under price, as you can see, but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design. We don't even have speakers here. Like we... what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that? I really like to that. No, we haven't. Transreader receiver speakers plus the extra device itself that's going to be on a TV, is that going to be a button or... It literally would just be a button. We might have to... It looks like almost nothing... No, good call, I missed that. I mean, it's not on here, but... No, it's a very valid point. Did they... do we have to use an advanced chip for the LCD? Yeah. Okay, I guess. So, if we're going to go with the LCD display, then that's... Was that hand down at dynamo? You have to wind it up? It's really so here. That would probably not be in keeping with the... Fashion statement, such, yeah. The basic of the only new thing is the LCD on the remote. The manipulated by the joystick here. Ah, I'm just... Which I'm defining as scroll wheel. And we can't replace the joystick quite because we would need for what your buttons do. Place it up down left and right, and that would be more expensive than it. But is the scroll wheel not just back and forth? Yeah, it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be that... That's what I've labeled it for, purposes of this evaluation. The LCD is the big, selling point of it. If we remove the LCD display, we could save ourselves a fair amount. Which you can't sort of make it original, but... Yeah. I think if we remove the LCD display, then there would absolutely no point to any of these meetings. We could just put our branding on any other remote control. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's a shame we should possibly... If we could have increased the price, we could have manufactured that, and then we could have got some people by closer to what we were. Does this open here? Does this bear in mind that... I mean, it's a bit ridiculous that they're going to charge us. Was it like this much money for three million if we're going to buy a three million components? You know. You'll have to argue with the accountants on that one. But for the purposes of this meeting, we're going to have to stick with these figures. So, I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're going to keep the LCD display. It's about what really separates us from the cost it's going to incur. Are people maybe not happy with what are willing to go ahead with this and going for a plastic solid case to keep the LCD? I want to think how much extra would it be to keep the articulation? It's hard to tell. I would say that you're at least going to take double-curve, but even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation. I think that it wouldn't require it to be double-curve. Yeah, it could still be similar curve. It's just that the case would come into it. Would be made in two parts and then trying to get it with an articulation. Could we not get rid of the curve? The curve is the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface. Could we have restrictions on? That's what we need for the joystick. I mean if you look closer at the prototype here, the lines here along grip are actually quite straight. But the curve is all over the hand. Yeah, on the LCD, although we've done it with the curve, it could just easily be done without curves. The curve that's really needed is up here to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position in fact to have it rest on the top of the hand. Okay, my bad. We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway. I mean, for the purposes of this meeting, maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation. Unless we hear otherwise, we could go ahead with that proposal. The product is not going to perform so well for my criteria. Which is what we can get onto now. As long as we're going to say, we'll have to keep an eye on the time as well, but we're going to say... Oh wait a minute. The single curve design. Sample speaker. What is the sample speaker? Is that somewhat similar to what we want? It could well be there. Of course. Of course. Of course. Of course. Of course. We've got the email about, I thought it was just completely pointless. You got an email about voice response? Yeah. I did not. All right. Basically, there's a signature labs that come up with a chip that you could say hello to and it would say hello back to your friends and family. Okay. We'll definitely go with that one. We won't go with that one, is it? I mean, that's voice recognition. Okay. Okay. So, okay. Battery definitely. So, it looks like we're going to get rid of the whole locator thing. It looks like it. Unless we can manage to put it in under point two euros. Okay. Maybe you know, you've pretty much point two euros, it's it. So, we'll leave that one for now. We'll go for a special color dot. It's a case of, I'm slightly unsure. 1.5 of a euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right. So, maybe it's a case of push button is maybe one or more. In which point for a case? Oh, do you already incorporate that? Oh, especially for the case. Well, you've got point five there. It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct. I'm not quite sure if there, I don't think you mean point five euros per button. Okay. Well, let's say that and then we can have our special colored case and then we at least have, make it a little harder to lose. There we go. Because most, most of the modes are a fairly dingy color that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap. What's the default color, the white or black? Black probably the normal color you'd see. Oh, great. I quite like that color with your effect. It's definitely make it glow in the dark even better. So, we'll go with that then. Okay. It's not, and we can see you will come back to your evaluation in which you're probably now going to pan us. Okay. Okay. So, just to give you an idea, you'll want to go maybe a bit quickly as well. I'm not sure how much time we've not hit the five minute mark. Right. We're working yet, but. Okay. Okay. Ability to start remote from Mingloss or to find them once they're lost. Okay. Special color. Special color. Four. Four. Three. Three for being generous. I think we can do three. Three. We're being generous here with three. The special color doesn't, what I think make a difference. It makes it stand out from, you know, it's lost in a big pile of crap. It stands out from the rest of the crap. Okay. We used to number of unused buttons. We're down to two buttons, is it? Two buttons. No joystick. Okay, so that's the one. You know, we're, that's the, yeah. Actually, we're going to do that. We're going to do that. We're going to do that. We're going to do that. We're going to do that. We're going to do that. Okay. That's the, yeah. Actually, we're doing well there. Okay, that was good. Easy to use interface. The buttons menu, menu is cool. That's, yeah, that's good. Okay, that's, we're not doing so badly. Easy to use. Oh, okay. That's forget that one. Fancy looking. It doesn't get much. Sure. We could do whatever we like with the LCD. Yeah, that's just assuming it's a good LCD display. Maybe I was panicking for no reason. I've got one on the fan. I'd say we go to because like the fanciest would be it'll occur. Yeah, maybe a bit. Yeah, with the articulators. There we go. Yeah, that's better to more accurate numbers, no logically innovative. Well, we're getting rid of the locator thing, which is a shame, which, yeah. I believe for this for that. Free. Yeah. And the menus thing is something you don't know. We see on, um, on a remote. You see it in a lot of other places. Yeah, mobile phones. And what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control. So it's, you say free. I might go as far as two in there. Free. I'm giving it to you. Three. Free. Okay. Okay. Okay. And the next one anyway. So some people find pleasing. This is what they really would have wanted. It is. Yeah. Don't blame them. Um, because of the way that we've minimalized the number of buttons and such. Plastic. It sucks. But it's no worse than any of the other remote controls they have. That's true. It's not a step backwards. Yeah. Five. I give it six. Yeah. Okay. Let's give it six. Okay. That's totally from everything. Go for balance. And spy by the ladies, interior and clothing fashion. We could. What color will we get to make it? Lepor print. I would say give us a give us a selection of colors. Um, yeah, we'll be yellow for the prototype because we had yellow. If I were buying one, I'd go for perfect. Lepor print. Well, um, by this, I think it's more okay. So. Yeah. The color of the border there. It's fine. That's. Don't stand there. That yellow. Yeah. It would also help keep the product placement. Logo. Yeah. Well, it inspired by including clothing fashion. They're referring to the fruit and veg. Think. Is this like a banana type color? Could we stretch? No, there's no shape like a banana. It's a kind of. It won't be for just being. Oh, because it's flat. Objected. What is this? Fruit? It's just flat. I think. I think this is not particularly fruit and veg. Yeah. We might have to suffer badly because of one as well. Well, it's probably more fruit and veg in most of the things that are, yeah, bar fruit and veg. So. Four. Four. All right. That's very ambitious. I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criteria. I don't think it's the sole criteria for being inspired by this. Fashionable and inspired by current passions. I can't wait. I'm sorry. I didn't even know. Let's disfigure against this is their motto. Yeah. I'm not doing well. This is a strategy. Imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is going to be proportional to the marks. We might want to be a bit more skeptical about this one. What would you think yourself? I would say, I mean, it's not at all. In any way of shape or form. Well, it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow. That's pretty much banana like. Okay. Yellow banana light fingers. I think it's okay. It's got a curve to it. So, 5 is that so unreadable? Yeah, I got stretching the use of a banana. Yeah. Okay. So, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So, 5, 7, 10, 16, and 21. This gives us an average of 3. Well, this would be in the middle. So, it's not bad. It's only good section. It's not bad and considering the... Don't pick the pen. Oops. Sorry. I'm sorry. What do you not like? I'm not going to say it's bad design. Considering the price we had to get this in. To have a positive, you know, even based on the four of us being heavily biased. Yeah. It was going to be quite hard to get anything standing out, I could say, possibly, based on the cost features. So, even if we were to increase this entire thing by 7, we were to go down a grade to 4. We would have to do... I mean, we weren't that kind of optimistic, too overly optimistic. We didn't add... We didn't subtract our whole 7 points from the user thing. So, I think we're definitely on a good bit. Even if we gave this one 7, this one 7. That's still only 3H to points over 7. Yeah, we did... It was okay. It was good. Personally, I think given the product only replaces a single remote control that you've already got. Are people really going to show out 25 euros for something that's only marginally good? Well, it depends here what the target people are, like you'd say. Maybe fashion conscious women. Maybe women. We don't know. Look at that. It's cool. It looks like a banana. It's cool. It's got a look good in the sit and room. I think rather than the LCD. Whereas, more technical, like more people in the device technology, like it's good. It's going to LCD screens. Only got two buttons and a joy six. So, which kind of people would be more likely to buy? Probably the people technologically. They usually want to buy point and stuff. I think so. I mean, my mom still has not learned how to use text messaging on her phone and she's had it for a long time. You know, she uses it to make phone calls and that's it. That's it, mom. Yeah. So, I think if my mom saw remote control like this, we're only two buttons and a joystick. I mean, I'll probably be the first one to decide not to buy it. She would like, is this a remote control? I don't have to use it and stuff like that. Even if it is really user friendly to us, but where you see using menus all the time. I thought that's one of the things that because it's technically innovative, for someone who's sort of technophobic and fri- that simply looks unfamiliar or be daunting. Yeah. I think it's totally radical to have remote control, no number buttons. But like radical, good. I don't know how long we've got at least five minutes, I think. We will pop on to project evaluation. So, we've got these four criteria here for satisfaction. Does anybody want to have any opinions on any of them? For example, forward backwards, I suppose, the ability to work in this project using the technology we've been presented with. If people made good use of the pen and paper, I would say I have no noodles. I wrote Mary A. Page, but not. I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be. I think it's a really good thing that digital pens, most of it, they're the sectors that we use. It goes into their office. It would have been nice to be able to transfer our paper notes onto the computer or something. Yeah, that would have been pretty good. It does seem like a paper, still a heavy consideration for taking notes. So maybe this is literally just the way around it. I know how are people satisfied with the teamwork with managed to display today? I like it. Leadership. It's a great deal. Last one we've got is room for creativity. Until accounts came along. We're not lacking in ideas. Yeah, I think of in the end ideas that can be used and sadly is meaning not so much that we weren't full of ideas, but of ones that are going to allow us to actually build the thing. It's a bit of a pity. I would have to agree in that. I think we needed a larger budget. If you're going to aim your product maybe at technological sector, then you can afford to maybe check the price up slightly from what it is. Because they will pay what they just cash at the people. I think for retaining the more of a biomarker form and the articulation would gain more profit and sales than it would lose in added expense. The price was twice the assembly cost. Would it have to be twice that? It could have had the assembly cost. It could have had the cost of maybe 50 or so. It could still have set up for 25. That's true. I think the tools we use all have to be taken up with a different group I guess as to who the cost involved. But we've got a prototype. I think it's gone okay today considering the information that we have. Maybe the accounts would have been better if we had a list from a... Yeah, to begin with. Probably would have come up with a lot more solid design in the end. I would have to agree. It is very much a pity to get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too extensive. Always hard to tell until you know the costs. Okay. I had a cost with him budget. There are now that we have a slightly less than capable product. We evaluated it and we can see that we came out with a value of 3. One thing I would say, I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product. The product testing and market research process would be to produce more cups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over budget would make to sales. Which, yeah, unlike response from consumers, we could even market two versions. We keep the version to be nice, I love it, I love it. And then the final one where you get to call it how. But we'll go into that later. Right. Is there anything else that anybody would like to add? No. Anything that's not being covered before I quickly write up the final report. I don't know, I mean we've got a product. We maybe aren't as happy with it as we like to be. But we've got something we think we can maybe stick on to the market and sell. And of course something we have been avoiding talking about because we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers. There's a huge market. I mean we briefly touched in a move, no more knowledge than there's little we can say in that. Yeah. So, um, let's say nobody's got anything they'd like to add. We can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we need to and then we can finish up the writing and such. Yeah. Okay. Thank you for your participation. Thank you. Wait a minute. I was actually kind of upset, you know, at the budget and that we had to cut a lot of stuff. But man, we can't have the location thing. That's fast. If there maybe were the prices were made. That's a question you can ask in a while. Okay.",
        "abstract": "The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented a prototype for the remote the team is designing and discussed its ergonomic appearance and its features. The marketing expert began to lead the team in conducting an evaluation of the prototype but was interrupted when the project manager shifted the discussion to examining the production costs of the team's product. The original specifications of the team's product proved to be too expensive and so the team had to discuss which features to lose and which to maintain in order to meet the target cost. After discussing costs, the team returned to conducting their product evaluation. The prototype was evaluated on the basis of its ability to be located when misplaced, ease of use, appearance, technological innovativeness, and sponginess. Overall, the prototype received average marks. The team then evaluated the project process, finding that they were happy overall but quite displeased with the small budget.",

She can hold on to me. Yeah, I'll go. This is my birthday. Okay. Yeah. God. She's gonna fall off. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hello everybody. I'm Sarah, project manager. And this is our first meeting. It's a surprising event. Okay, this is our agenda. We will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better. We'll come to it with each other. Then we'll go to the training, talk about the project plan, discuss our own ideas and everything. And we've got 25 minutes to do that as far as I can understand. Now we're developing a welcome approach. We've got a bunch of people already know. We want it to be original, something that people haven't thought of. It's not out in the shops. Trendy, appealing to a wide market, but not a hunk of metal. And user friendly, granny, two kids, maybe even creatures should be able to use it. Okay. First is the functional design. This is where we all go off into our individual work. What needs need to be fulfilled by the product. What effects the product has to have. And how it's actually going to do that. Conceptual design, what we're thinking, how it's going to go. And then the detailed design, how we're actually going to put it into practice and make it work. Okay. Right. We're going to practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the whiteboard agrofers. And sum up the characteristics of that animal. So. Okay. Okay. At this space for everyone else. Okay. We're running it, please. Okay. I'm not going to ask you to guess I'm going to tell you that this would be a tiger. And I see them as majestic and independent and proud. Now we'd like to go next. Okay. Wish. Got. Is this going from. Thank you. Maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make. I kind of talk. Yeah. It's actually sitting. Sorry. It's sitting. It's not standing. Okay. I see it as one thing. It's very supportive. It's your best friend in you. You can talk to a dog. It can be a best friend. It doesn't discriminate between you based on what you are. Second, it's loyal. And third thing, it's got intuition. Means dogs can sometimes make out between a thief and a person. So basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Sorry. Please, please leave me a space at the bottom. I'm a little. All right. We're standing on a chair. Well, since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do. Okay. Have some guys who've been saying a bit random. And also my drawing scale isn't that great. Well, as you can see, the quality of the work today. I think it's that standing we're good. Okay. Now I'm going to have to change what it was originally going to be because that looks like a beak now. So. Crocodile. Yeah, it can be a crocodile. It can be a crocodile. It can be a crocodile. Well, it was it was the first. It was an attempt to a T-regs and then it sort of changed into a pelican, but it can be a crocodile. Yeah. That's lovely. Yeah. And I have to think on the spot of the things that it is. Um, uh, scary. Uh, strong. Yeah, that's fine. I think. Okay. I'm very impressed with your artistic skills. Mine's a dreadful. Oops. This is now coming apart. I just put the top in. I'll put that click in. I'll just, I'll hold it on. Okay. Oops. Oh, dear. What happened there? Technical help. Hopefully that'll stay on 200 version. Okay. Uh, again, this is off the top of my head. I was going to do a big count too. And, dear, it doesn't look like what I wanted to be. It's not a vampire bat, honestly. Somewhere there's a body behind. That's my dreadful, that's the worst yet. It's meant to be an eagle. Right. You can tell it's a flying animal. Could have been a seagull. I never thought of a seagull. Any eagle. Again, I'm thinking on my feet. Goodness. But they're also independent. I'll put that one down again. Tada. Um. They get a go. Independent. Independent, right? Did you say they're good at golf? Yeah. Are they? They're good. Oh, right. I'm not good at golf. I'll say they're quite free spirited. Flying around everywhere. Doing their own thing. And birds of prey, aren't they? Oh, dear. Intrepid. Intrepid. There we go. That pen is going to be okay. Whoops. Okay. That's right. Finance wise, we've got a selling price at 25 euros, which I don't actually know what that is. At all. Any ideas? 17. One point four. You know, would make a bond or something. Yeah, yeah. 17. 17. 17 pounds. Okay. Should we be making notes of this? We can just refer to this later. I think so. I think I'd be able to put the app on a cable and show to older. Having said that though, if you want to get one of those, the ones on the market, the moment, they're about 20 pounds anyway. Right. Yeah. We have one. So I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price. Or is it going to make our product look cheapy, cheapy? Yeah. Production costs at 1250. So the unique margin. Half of the selling prices. Yeah. Taking that by building it. And profit aim is 50 million euros, which is a... You know, first year? Yes. Yeah. I presume so. You've got market range international. And you did see earlier it's got to be accessible and usable by all age groups. We're not focusing on business market, any particular thing. It's everyone, user-friendly to everyone. Okay. Big target group. Yes. I don't think we have to... I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that, making that key point just that it's going to be an international market. Like, that's trading America, things like that. Okay. So, what are your experiences in film and controls? I mean, I've got... We got... We had three videos, a TV and sort of amp thing all set up. So we got one of the Universal and Moct controls. Yeah. And the program, each of you is going to be empty. But that kept losing the signals. So we have to reprogram it every now and again. I think it was quite cheapy as well. Yeah. I think I was going to do that. But that was quite good, the fact that you could... You saw the ones that you haven't. You didn't have six remote controls in front of you. You want to do good everything into one, like... Yeah. My experience has only been given the remote control with the object I buy, not doing any tampering with it and programming, using it to program TV videos and things. But basically, on or volume up and down, channel one to that basic function... I don't think I could go any further with it than that. So it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well. Yeah, that's the main stuff anyway. And you don't want to... I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words to think what they all do. I'm just sitting there searching for the teletext button. And symbols that you don't necessarily understand. Symbols are meant to understand that you don't. When you've got the main things on the front, and a section opens up for something to the other functions when you can do sound or... Oh, yeah. ...recording things like that inside it. Because it doesn't make it up, it doesn't make it be complicated to look at. It's obvious what you're doing. Actually, that just raises a point. I wonder what our design people think. But you know on a mobile phone, you can press the key and it gives you a menu. It's got a menu display. I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful to you. You've got a little LCD display. I was thinking of the same lines you... Instead of having too many buttons and making it complicated for the user, maybe having a LCD display or something like that, like a mobile. With menus. And with menus. Yeah. And if it's somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phones, people might find it easier to browse and navigate also. Yeah. What about the older generation? What about Granny and Grandad? My grandfather can answer his mobile phone. He couldn't even dream of texting or something like that. Can he program his remote controller? Is he basic with that too? I don't think they're taping. Yeah. My grandfather thought she better than me using teletax, right? Right. So that's a problem, regardless of any design modifications you come up with. Yeah. That's going to be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps. And that's another... I'll be talking about. Yeah. Why it just needs to be... As long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can work out why everything's doing. Because I mean menus on sort of neat phones now, they've got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do. I don't know how. I don't know how. I don't like the new phones that kind of got a Windows-based running system. I find it really confusing. I kept getting lost in the phone. I've not got a new one but my friend got a new one. And I'm trying to do things with it. And I just kept getting lost. But that's just me. Yeah. I don't know how for 25 or 12 euros 50, how much of an excellent screen you could get. Yeah. You'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white LCD thing. It's possible that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for a large print, like you do in large print books. Obviously it displays less on the screen, it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it, that's the main thing. Yeah. Or what about kind of a dual function in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play volume program things. And also, and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures, obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that. The other thing is just tucking into mobile phone design features again. You could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top, your screen is, you can have a bigger screen in the flip over. I think that's a cost of thing. I don't know how much we're going to know about. But it's a bit of space. Instead of looking bulkier, it might look small. But it might have a small cost implications. And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone. It can still be lightweight plastic, you know. Something that's easily molded and produced. Sorry, I'm trying to have a new territory guy. Right, okay, we've got half there for the next meeting. So we're all going to go off and do our individual things. I think that's probably about it. And then we'll come back and do it again. And I get to do another fantastic project. Just a quick thing about the, what you're saying about the, doesn't need to be fashionable. So I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the, we put the fashion into electronics. I think the whole design thing might be, I mean, you don't. You can still have plastic and it looks quite good. Yeah, I mean, it doesn't have to be that, you know, that was my main point. We do have to use metal. I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper, I presume it would. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. I mean, the sky will look like controls. And they're kind of molded and look a bit different than the telewesterial controls. It's a silver plastic. It looks a bit slightly. So, yeah, I guess that's the second. Okay. So, let's break up there. Okay. Okay. So, see you in half an hour. Do we go back to our roofing system? Yeah. Yeah.",
        "abstract": "The Project Manager gave an introduction to the goal of the project, to create a trendy yet user-friendly remote. She presented a long-range agenda for the whole project. The group introduced themselves to each other and practiced with the meeting room tools by drawing on the board. The Project Manager presented the project budget, the projected price point, and the projected profit aim for the project. Then the group began a discussion about their own experiences with remote controls to generate initial design ideas for making the product user-friendly. They discussed grouping features into a menu and adding an LCD display. They also discussed the look of various materials that may be used in the design, in keeping with the company's goal to create fashionable electronics.",

        "transcript": " Help. Help. Is that fair? Um, let's raise that. No, no really too hard. I don't like it. Okay. I don't like it. Okay. Right. Okay. Um, right. Okay. Um, and then I'll give it a little bit. Um, right. I'll agenda for today. Do you want to give me a second? Uh, no, that's okay. So, um, I'll go over what was made of that. I'll give you a last. Okay. Um, we've signed upon a universal control. One hand that for all to be prepared. Um, that it was important that the project that built a wide range of consumers, wide age range, not limited to anyone, was signed with the important to reflect the company's image and aspect, with the fashion and electronics and the fact that it's thin. Um, our budget would have to affect, um, try not to reflect our budget, um, that we might have a bit of, oh, I'm confused. I think. Um, dissonance between what our budget was and what we wanted to look like. Um, wanted to look unflattered, undone to the customer, we discussed a flip over design, um, reducing the size of control and an electronic panel, um, the further features that the programming and things like that. Okay. Um, three presentations. I've got right here. So, should we give them my fingers? Um, is it okay if I just want that to later? I just want to get access to a little bit more information. Is that okay? Okay, yeah, I'll go first. Can I grab the... It's like me. Thanks. Um, what does press OFA? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is, uh, the working design presents by me, the, uh, industrial design and student math. Okay. This is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint, so. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint, so. What, the first thing question I asked is, what are we trying to design? Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change its say, whether that be the power or the channel. Um, or the volume, everything is just, um, some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliances, sending the signal to. Um, so I decided I'd have a look at what other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. But, uh, although we will want to be taking ideas from other people, we want to make sure that our design stands out. And I thought that was something that, well, it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside, really. Yeah, I ran out of time, so I can do this one. It's fun as the last time. Um, and, uh, I found out that most controls use some form of infrared sent signals to the TV, presumably because of the cost issue of, uh, something like, uh, the same thing that can be used wireless and you don't need to send very much information. Um, most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now, R1, I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A batteries, but those can be quite bulky. So I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else, um, so we could shrink down the size of the control. Can I interject to ask a question? Yes, you're right. You think the triple A batteries are small or the character? Um, no, no. If you look at, if you look at most remote controls, they're quite, they're quite chunky. And that's because of the size of the batteries. They have to be, obviously, this certain size to fit those batteries in. Triple A's are the smaller sugar. Yeah, well, you can get the sort of circular round ones, but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the, the, the battery across, and which leads sort of on to the next point about being small and easy to carry around. Um, now the ones are the moment are small, but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. Now, the main components I came up with, um, were obviously the power source for the batteries, because otherwise it's not going to work. Uh, as I said about the, of which batteries we were going to choose, we can discuss that later. And then obviously you need something to decode the information that you're putting in from, from the controller and to turn it into an infrared signal, which we're going to use to send the information. Now, these have a wireless range up to about five meters, which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching their TV and less than any cinema, which not most people do say, as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine. And then I was, uh, just had a quick look at the external design, but I, I left that mostly to the, uh, interface designer. And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we want to do. It's not a proper circuit. I'm not sure if it'll work or not. I'm not even confident that those are the real, um, the real way you'd wire out. But anyway, we've just got the, the power going to the infrared bowl with the chip and the, uh, UI interface, um, which would basically, when you, when you pressed anything, it would, the chip would convert it into some form of our data, which could be decoded by the TV receiver, which obviously means that we're going to have to conform to whatever, um, whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using. And since that, that's another reason to use infrared, because that's what all TV's using. And then finally, um, we want, uh, the, it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost. So all the components that I've put forward are, uh, low in costs. So that should be good. Um, it should, it should be different enough, um, from the alternative products to get a good consumer base. We're talking about it before. And also just something that I was thinking about, uh, because they're small. They're also easy to lose. So if we could look into some way of, you know, some anti going down the side of the sofa, um, thing that you could have, I, that was just sort of a general point there. That's a very important point. It came up in our market research findings too. So I can refer to that. All right. Okay. And I really like to present. And yeah, that's, that's what I came up with there. Um, would you like to come in? Yeah. Um, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe. Yeah. Just to the further. Um, I think that's okay. I think it's right. Function. I think. I think. Okay. Yeah. Actually, some of my points might overlap it, but well, you just mentioned. But basically, my method was like, um, whatever brainstorming we did in the last minute. Just to cover valuable points and started developing on that. And there might be some missing loops in this thing, which I think will take a feedback from the marketing because. I haven't had some marketing data. And basically every product is market driven. So purpose as William already said, I would put it to simplify the interaction with TV to make make it as simple as possible. And to summarize, I would say it should be user-friendly by being easy to use. Rather than having a lot of complex patterns because you can have an engineering driven, maybe having 100 buttons and maybe having a remote control, which has the main features like volume control or channel changing the channel. But we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it will punch in these two features together. So what the concept is to have a flip top on the main function, such as which are like often used will be on the top. And the complex functions which say you can say like the young generation or 20 generation want to. Say program their favorite channel or whatever can be put in the middle part of the flip top. So it could be accessed by a wider range of audience. And we can punch in new features such as added features such as shockproof body and maybe designed to appeal to a lot of people. Finding most people prefer user-friendly rather than complex remote controls. Because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they are not used maybe 42% or 40% of the buttons. So it's not of no use of punching in those, trying to put in those things on the top of the remote control and try to confuse a user. As we saw we have to make a profit also. So we can maybe go for an economy of a higher production by 50 million we say. Yeah. With that I think we will be able to achieve economies of scale also. So we can add more features and make it less costly. And that's so this is if you ask me personally I would make a flip top with the 20 design and maybe we should look at also like the buttons where whether they are like soft or little hard or the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous usage and all that. So overall a simple and user-friendly design. Any comments? I think which aspect at the end? Okay. Okay. So anyone wants to write something down? I want to put them on at the end. I've got to keep this here. You've got to move it one time. I have to move it one time. What? I have to push it a bit more. A bit more? Yeah. I'll do it. Okay. I want to go a bit more. Is that okay? I'll put it on. Thank you. Just a little bit closer a little bit. You should be able to. Get it right over. Okay. Thank you. Okay. I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view. And obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research. So that's where we started. We used our usability lab, the company's usability lab. We did our usual selection methods to get across section of the general public, male and female, all age groups from 15 upwards. And we observed them in the lab. Just their general use of the remote control. You can see we had a hundred subjects there. Our findings, lots of findings. I've just summarized some of them here. The overall thing, which I've got at the top there in italics, is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote control. So that has obvious design implications there. We found that 75% of users find most remote controls ugly. 80% would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. We were quite surprised by that finding. But that's quite a high proportion of our international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking. Current remote controls do not match well with the operating behavior of the user overall. For example, you can see, although they're 75% of users zap a lot. So you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel hopping. So again, there's power implications there. 50% of users only use 10% of the buttons. So again, a big design issue there. And possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. The biggest frustrations that people find with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier. Remote controls are often lost in the room. It's slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing. 50% were particularly frustrated by that. 34% of people take too much time to learn to use. And I think that ties in with the previous finding of people only using 10% of the buttons. They just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions. Slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury. You know, there's small movements so the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems. The vast majority of the 35 and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition. Again, that was to aid, I think, when they've lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition. Something we didn't put to them, which I'm thinking of now, is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again until you find it or are flashing lights. Possibly. That trend reverses in the older age groups. So 35 and under who would like those two features. That kind of evens out 35 to 45 and in the older age group it kind of reverses. They're not supported with this. I had marvelous tables and things that I could show you, but I think I'll just keep it simple. If there's any more information I can email you extra details, is that okay? Right. We have new project requirements. We're not going to be using teletext. Apparently consumers consider outdated with the internet now. Our control is only going to be for TV. It's not going to be a combined control, which limits all of the different things. It limits the cost for us, but it also makes it easier to understand both. So can we not program a video with this remote control? There's for TV only, so it looks like it. Just channel health. Yeah. I think maybe sky, things like that might be incorporated into it, but I don't know what do you think? It just said for TV only. Would that imply a video you use in channels? Yeah. You do video as well. Well, I don't know because the way you get combined TV only is that. Yeah. If you've got a sky box, one of those sky plus boxes now you can record straight off TV anyways. On to like the TV hard drive or something. I think we have seen it still got small and start coaching. Yeah. Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want to combine something or not? We didn't really look into that, but remember we found that finding that most people only use about 10% of the buttons. I think that those did tend to be the basic channel hopping things on and off for the video, fast forwarding, so on. And I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos are nice. So I don't know if that's something we need to do. Just as an idea on the speech recognition thing. So it would probably be quite expensive to incorporate it into our speech recognition thing and they're not that great. In fact, I've just called up that table there. We asked those two questions. The table relates to both questions that we didn't differentiate. Would you prefer an LCD screen that's multi-function remote and would you pay more of the speech recognition in remote control? So you can see how the yes, no sort of varies across the age group there. A substantial number of don't know in the older age group. I think that's just general fear of new technology. But on that again, I just thought, because you can get those key chains now and you whistle. And then it'll allow for loud noise to let you know where it is. So I thought that could be for you. We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves. So I think when we can take it to an option which still does the same thing. Because it needs to be the thing that you used to find it needs to be something that you don't lose. You're just kind of whistling. Maybe on the TV you could put like a pack on the TV or something. So you can't see the remote. You go and press the button on top of the TV and it beeps. And it's over there. It's super easy to do that. But that sounds a lot cheaper. Yeah. The third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the hand-fed. So we want logo, we want fashionable trendy. I mean what you're talking about with the marketing. People paying more for it to loot goods. We need to focus on that. What else? Further market research will be needed to focus on what that is. It's going to be different for a 15-year-old for somebody who's 60. And also across the world of the very main international market. What is attractive to a trending New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African? I don't know. You get the idea. It's going to vary around the world. At the end of the day, the engineering design is one thing. It's the user interface design that made the fashionable aspect of it. We might have to change the different markets around the world. Are we talking about a single model or maybe a six design? Well, yeah, you could have a number of different designs. I mean inside that would be essentially exactly the same. We just could be saying that the body could look like that. What about, we were talking about the buttons. The controls that are coming out now have kind of big rubber buttons. Not tiny little, big rubber buttons. But what about, I mean because we've got to make it original. What about, you know, with a touch screen? Yeah, yeah, that's what I was just saying. Yeah. So it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button. Which shouldn't wear out as much. Well, no, because you wouldn't have to. You don't have to press it, you just have to put your thumb onto it. I think that might appeal to Japan thinking young, office people trendy. Yes. With a few sections of the market death. But quite easily labeled so that anyone can... Oh yeah, that's obvious what that's born. And it's not daunting to maybe the older generation. Well, say ergonomics, as we're saying with the different designs. Ergonomics, there's sort of physically different things. Because if you've ever seen the Xbox, they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it. Because the controller was physically too big. They're cut just generally Japanese people have smaller hands. So they can get around the controller. So if you... I don't know what, because obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something. And then smaller ones for others. Yeah. Maybe to... It was indicated that the risk of a repeated use, the injuries. Maybe your touch screen could be a better option for them. Yeah. So a bigger... Okay, so you're dividing designs, not only segment, age groups, you're dividing it according to the countries also. Maybe for US and all, you can have a slightly bigger remote. And maybe in Japan and all, you need to have a small... I think we have to design one product. And then the company can take it wherever they want to. And in the sense that they can make it smaller, they can make it bigger, or they can change features slightly. The internal engineering design has got to remain the same. It's going to be the same. So we need to focus on just one thing. You can't get bogg down in lots of different possibilities. I'm concerned when you read the RSI issue, again, a competitive strain injury. I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that. I think that is still a kind of question mark. It's you how we deal with that. RSI tends to be caused by repetitive small movements. I really can't get my head around this one. It's me who have to be postponed to a future meeting. But it's something we should think about. Yeah, I was just thinking about how you combat that. Because without doing something where you have to move your arms. I know, and it becomes ridiculous. On speech recognition. Yeah, on speech recognition. Which is extremely exciting. I think that's the only way that you can avoid that kind of issue. Do we have to initially, you know, looking at the findings here, focus on a younger age group initially, and then broaden out the market later? Do we really have to go for everyone right away? Focus on the biggest market. The same people between age group of 20 to 35. When we've been throwing up our ideas, we're automatically talking about business people, young people, 20 people. We are retarded by the type of company that we're working for as well. They want it to be fashionable, they want it to be trendy. And you wouldn't automatically assume, associate that with older generation. Now, with the baby boomers, the older generation is actually larger than, have a great population than us young people. But I don't think we're focusing on that. I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range business kind of class. I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too, but when it does get to the broad scale marketing stage, we want to, you know, not waste money, not be profligate. And, you know, focus on where the idea will be taken up. First, it's much likely to be taken up. First of all, where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this. Okay. So, the remote control functions, we've got the TV, we've got the video. Now, there's, I can't remember what it's called, the little code at the end of program details. Video class? Yeah. We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that. Yeah. Is that, I always found that really easy when I discovered it. Because you've got your general record anyway. If there's a program on, you won't put the record on that time. But if you do want to tape something in the day time, you're not sure if you're going to, you put the number in. It's not a date, it's not a time, it's not a channel, it's not when it finishes, it's not. Anything like that, it's just number. And you wouldn't, you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that. You just need, like, because you've already got the number. You've already got the number. I'm not coming across that function, but it sounds wonderful. Is after, if you look in the new safer TV guide or any TV guide, there's a six-digit number afterwards, and that number you put in. And it's recorded, but it's going to be on on Tuesday at 10 o'clock on the 17th. Things like that, so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times. And it has been around. It's been around for a long time. It's just, it's not very well advertised. No, it's not. I think if awareness was kind of much before fun about that. Yes. So if you've got something like Sky anyway, you can just click on it. You can just press the button on the program once, and it will record that program. Right. When it's on, and you press it on it twice, and it will record the whole series. Excellent. So that, yeah. But just have that function with you. It'd be really good. Okay. Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me? I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another, but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups. It occurs to me, I already produced there on mobile phones. That's kind of what led us on to comparing TV and remote controls with their design features. Chain companies like Carphone Warehouse, you can pop in any time with a phone that you've bought for them. If you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it or form the company, you can use their telephone. Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar kind of service? So that if older users were deterred from buying this, they can just pop in to another high street outlet. Which button is that I press for this? That's a free aspect of our service. But that'll not make it more attractive to them. But the only problem is that with a mobile phone, you sign for a contract. So the companies who you deal with have actually, they've got an obligation to help you out. And also, I mean, it's fair enough that I have some sort of help service. But I'm not sure how much the cost would be. Right. The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there, you're pressing the button and your TV's not doing it. All right. Taking your TV and your phone, you're saying, look, this is what I'm doing. It's not what I'm doing. If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel. So we're any more or absolutely definite. It's only going to be for TV and video. I mean, just a thought. I mean, instruction books. I feel like it's not. I mean, there's customer service. There will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to. And that way there's no call out charge. There's no extra person who has to walk to a shop in the high street. Yeah. I think I have to make up an award for a person to, for a phone, maybe he might walk down this street. But for a remote, he will just... Not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that. We should focus on making manuals. It's user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just trying to write in lots and lots of pages. It's people of reading them, so they just do the obvious. Yeah. They just throw into the sun and go strong and then you try and touch through it. Sure. That should be something that they might. What other functions that you need? I'm not sure if we need a design decision now. But we should think about... Because you've got the dilemma between old battery, that's what I was thinking about. What about old batteries? What kind of battery is that? They're... They're specially made for the mobile phones. But they come with a charger. I mean, you could... You could bundle a charger. They've been last quite a long time. And if you had... When you've been seeing that you get with them or well, headphones. You sit it in its charger when you're not using it or that night or something. But it doesn't really matter because it never really runs out. Because it lasts a long time when it's charged. Something like that. Shoot with juice. Yeah, and if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper and the room that could... Yeah, it could be on that. Yeah, on that as well. Okay. So, are we talking about a concept of rechargeable? Yeah, some sort of docking station, you know. Rechargeable with a different type of thing. Yeah. So the rechargeable, which is for you? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that'd be fine. And also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time. Yeah, what's it? It's two for you. Yeah, so... The shape... You've got trendy. I don't want a big box with lots of things. You don't want a tiny sort of little thing either. Because then you have got the repetitive string you know, matter how many... How much you try and make it simple. And we don't... I mean, so many remote controls look absolutely identical. There's a lot of brown things with the same coloured buttons or crammed in on the surface. We definitely... An obvious thing, a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles. We don't want that. Okay, so we go off the screen. What I was thinking of a design which Nokia came of it almost 6 or 7 years back. Basically, we have a flat one. It looks like a box, like a chocolate. That's very stringous because your thumb is slightly up. So they come of it something like this. Covered up. So here. And you don't have to... You know, bend your thumb too much. You can say... That's hard. Kind of think curved up here. Okay. So what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like this. So it's already curved up. So you can almost... So we can have a... You know, molded according to your... Yeah. The way you hold up... It's kind of semi-circle in the bottom. That's fine. I wouldn't say exactly semi-circle but... You look into the company logo... Things that are associated with the company in view to... Trying to incorporate that into the design of the product. For example, if it was a C or something like that... You could have it in a vague C shape to open that kind of like a shell or something. Something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite often. Obviously, into this design while also making it quite different. It's very satisfying. You could look in that part. But what we were talking is to make it... Other than like C shells logo could become... You could put a logo in the corner of the model. Rather than you're not trying to make it like a C shell or whatever you're telling me. Well, we need to think about how it's going to look different. I think that's... that sounds a really attractive idea. Not come across anything like that before if it kind of... Yeah, and that opens out into your flip top. And it's nice to... You can make it lightweight plastic, nice to hold in the palm of the hand. And just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers... That's going to take care of some of the repetitive strain injury... Trying to create a lot of that out of the thing. I think it's a really nice idea. And plus... You can get... Even though we're using plastic, you can still... I mean, if you think of the design you can get in plastic. You can do a nice con shell or a scallop shell. It's easier. You could do... Different... Like you get with mobile phones, different fashers. You could have different kind of casings. Yeah, so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleep ones. Less chance of it being lost too. It's not like a chocolate-brown lozenge that's going to go down the sofa. People might want to put it on their man, talk piece or whatever. If it looks attractive enough, as a kind of ornament, they're not going to lose it so much. It's easier to fit nice to handle. Yeah, maybe we could come with some safe plastic designs and then choose which are... Which are up in some rest. Like, that could be the most common design. Okay. If you can think of plastic stresses. Right, I think we have to round it out. Can I just quickly go over the new project requirements that I haven't missed anything? There's no teletext, only for TV and by implication video. Corporate image should be incorporated in their own control. Something about video plus. That was in cutting down the number that was cut down the number and called function. Right, making it simpler to instead of having lots of things. So when they press for programming, you could come up on the LCD reminder about using video plus so that they will look at the guide and... Is this nothing to do with the project requirements? Is this just... that was an add-on feature? It kind of takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having a right press for the channel, things like that. So it's kind of doing away with the programming feature. Yeah, it should be an advertisement feature rather than design feature. You know, draw attention to that and also pay lip service in the instruction manual. Because it's very simple to put it down in words. Should be helpful. And to be chargeable battery. Was there anything else there that you project requirements? We've got the button that I think will work through that with the design event. That's not at the moment our requirement is something we're looking at. We'll press for and so it may come around to market research at some point. We talked about there being the alarm or something, it being paying or being lost. Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible. There aren't going to be that many functions incorporated into it. So it should be fine. And the instruction manual. I don't know if we deal with that. I think it's different than what that means. Okay. Yeah, I think that's us. What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting? Or shall I just generally look at all the issues that you've asked? I think you might get guidance, but I... ...insured the manuals. Because it has to be a demonized thing there. Everyone's got like big pilots and but no one really uses that one. Okay. Oops. Cushion airfoil. Yes. Right. Because we're at lunchtime now I think. I think you can email me. If there's any more questions. I'll see you next time.",
        "abstract": "The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote. He presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design. The User Interface Designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface. The Marketing Expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device, and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology. The Project Manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function, that it be used only to control television, and that it include the company image in its design. The group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market. They discussed the functions the remote will have, including Video Plus capability and rechargeable batteries. A customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly, but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget. The group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers.",
        "actions": "The Marketing Expert will research consumers' opinions on instruction manuals.",
        "decisions": "It was decided that the group will produce one product design instead of creating alternate designs in an attempt to accomodate different users' preferences. The marketing will be focused towards a young, business-class buyer. The remote will feature Video Plus capabilities and a seashell-like shape to accomodate the LCD display and the flip screen. The remote will be bundled with a docking station to recharge the remote's batteries and a user-friendly instruction manual, and multiple casings will be made available.",

        "transcript": " I'll wait until you're all in. I'll wait until you're all in. Welcome back everybody. I hope you had fun. Right. This is our conceptual design meeting. I'm going to give you a quick look at the design meeting. I'm going to give you a quick look at the design meeting. Welcome back everybody. I hope you had fun. Right. This is our conceptual design meeting. I think we're starting to head over ourselves from the last meeting. Yeah. I was getting the impression as well. I think yeah. This is where we talk about Provide to use materials, user interface, and trends, and trends. I think we've touched on a few things to be left already but we'll just go over it. The minutes from last time we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext. It wasn't going to be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it. We have decided on leaving out the voice recognition. We've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. We were thinking a shell but something along the sides just different shape from what's normal. You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries. Yep. We were going to think about the port and alarm for getting it off. Things like that. Our market was going to be young business kind of range. Okay, so she was starting with the first presentation. Yes, I hate the...just connect up. Thank you. Okay, so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend-watching. The methods we used to decide on current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with our 100 subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most important aspect we had in our remote control device and we'll come to that later. So that was one of the first things we did. Also with our company being four owners in putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. So the general findings from that was in the market trends, the most important aspect from the market trends. So the general findings from that was that in the market trends, the most important aspects for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel, rather than the current functional looking feel of remote controls. They also want a remote control to be technologically innovative and of course as we predicted that it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel is the most important, as twice as important as the second technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. So possibly the feature that we put first is actually third. It's still important, but it's third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at. Okay. Now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group, we found from our consultants in Paris and Milan who attended all the designing fashion fears then, but fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too? There also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials again in contrast to last year. So a lot of interesting feedback, they're both from our market research department and from our people in Paris and Milan. We're interesting to see what our design people make of that. So we're very much let's start from inside and work our way out. Yep, okay. Unless anyone has any questions about that? Not yet. Okay. Yes. Thank you. I hope this got a finish. Yeah. I say if you do the one too tight and you can't get the new furniture on there. I know. Okay. This is all about the design of the edge components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. Okay. First, the... into the method, the main idea of the whole thing is just so you... you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting it should be easy to find. Also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials because some of the things that we looked at last time unfortunately aren't available. Findings. I've got my nice little picture there. This is the chip called the TA-W1-A35 which is what's used in pretty much every remote control because it sends out standard signals based on your input. It's pretty much used for all TV remotes at the moment. And then we're looking into battery options. There's actually no rechargeable option available. So I saw the standard AA and triple AA which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment. Dynamo charging. I thought that might be a bit silly to be honest. It's basically like wind up radio. So you wind up your remote control before you use it. How long can you get out of that? Can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night? Yeah, I presume you wouldn't have to wind it for very long but I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you think of the next two options like the solar charging. Most people have the light on in the room anyway. So they could get when you got to do it. Is it? I'll write it. Regarding the sizes, which one you think will be like because we have to take into consideration size also. So maybe standard triple AA might take less space or might take more space? Yeah, it would. The dynamo would take more space because you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up. I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun. Yeah, okay. I don't think it can. But I mean, that's not many. You don't want to limit your market. I mean, people who live in basements like there's not that many people. I know, different products are people too. If we're at the marketing internationally. Yeah, most people, most people also watch TV in the night. Yeah, but then it would be charging to the day. I think the point is they charge us through the day. And then you've got it charged. But I think the next one's the best anyway. The kinetic charging, which is like you get it in wristwatches. Yeah, and you don't even notice it. I mean, the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge it up. I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work. And are this like a, what is the life of the kinetic battery? It's like it runs for a long time. Yeah, it charges into some form of, it's a smaller cell, which it charges into. And the size of a watch battery, because they use them quite frequently and watch it. And that would last for, well, I don't, I'm not entirely sure how long it would last, but I've never seen one run out. But then if you think about watch, it's on your wrist, but it's on your whole body, it's on your body the whole time. So you're walking around you doing things. It is moving a lot of the time. Yeah, and you switch the TV on, then you put it on the side, then you pick it up to change it, then you put it on the side. Yeah, but then again, I think it is, because if you think about it, watch, although it's only a tiny amount, it's always moving for the whole day. And they don't run out overnight when you leave them on the side. Okay. And for the same reason, you're only using it for an incredibly short amount of time, just to send the signal, and then you're finished with it. You put it on it. No, no, I don't think the drone will see. Referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with standard batteries? I mean, could people put standard batteries in, but they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging? Or the two things not compatible? Yeah, I think you could have a dual power thing, but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case. And they, because if you, like, on a calculator, they're quite big and they all look identical. They're very expensive. They're expensive, they don't... I presume that normal batteries were the cheapest. Yeah, the normal batteries would be the cheapest. I presume that then it would actually be the solar charging ones, but the... I think they're not very resistant to dropping, because if you drop stuff, yeah, if you have the size you'd need to charge it, need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remote always get thrown around and stuff so yeah I think yeah practically I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes do they can't do yeah they do they yeah they've got dual things but the battery is smaller I think which one would last the longest because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day remote control like so yeah so if you if you had something using the standard batteries and the silent charging I don't think you'd I think they would you know how long the standard double A's would last in or just a charge from the attractiveness of the whole future yeah I think it would yeah okay can we add in attachment to clothing feature okay can we think about that because if we're doing the kinetic thing yeah shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I've got to think about right okay because if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape now the kinetic is something people don't do kind of we're doing something original and different and if you wore it if it's something you could just click on your pocket then you would have that less you wouldn't lose it yeah but then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of it it's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research it's not a thing that people are looking for okay let me throw it open to the field okay something to put on the side to think about it okay right okay well I'll move on my second part of my findings the most current remates use this silicon PCB board which print printed circuit board which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this LED and a sequence of on and off bursts what kind of things do we have to consider there can we what kind of slides does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size well the thing about it is that they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print a circuit board like that that it's it's simply space like that so you can have fit the size of the nine buttons in if you see how thin the tracks are you could you could you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one if you if you wanted to but the there is an option to do to do it like that or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit so that and then to yeah so to conserve battery life from most being a stamp I'm not while not being used and what I was thinking about that was because sometimes when when you have these things have got little lights on behind the buttons so you can see what all the buttons are like on a mobile phone they do it more often than on a on a TV remote but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds and not being used I'd have that turned off if we decided to go for buttons that could light up the case material I've been sent what the factory can actually give us the there's the plastic which I think we were going to go for anyway as the main case case housing and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think of the event practical titanium very expensive just the process which to make it is expensive and rubber where you're saying that people like this spongy feel this yeah so perhaps something made of rubber but I was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've said that they've put across are what is used in some stressful manufacture and it's meant to be anti-RSI I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said and the problem with the casing is that there's quite there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curve shapes but whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units for the flip phone yeah and second question is like mobile you can change the cover yeah yeah so in this case you be looking at like a custom again change the color like from green parrot green to chili red or something yeah is that feature available in like titanium or it's like only specific yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really the just it would well you could make it available in the titanium it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it because of the expense of how much titanium is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for it it does not quite easily to if you let it fall I've got a mobile for myself which is titanium and it does mark very easy yeah I'm just wondering if we make the basic mold out of plastic but have like a rubber cover yeah that you keep the spongy feel that also allows us to kind of have different and you can peel them off yeah instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic the fascia that comes like a rubber sleeve or a mask yeah yeah like those pens that you get with the grip yeah all right that could be good okay it could be comfortable to hold on very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one yeah yeah well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not yeah also the just just going back to the interface size with the buttons the I know we were planning to do some sort of touch screen now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare PCB circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colors and say just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection over if you had them close enough that would be one option the second option they offer rubber buttons but I thought that an LCD type of screen because one they're incredibly thin and don't take on much space to they you can have them in a sort of a rain you could arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of sat thing you could have them like a touch display oh what what just what you said I didn't get the meaning of it completely oh on the on the LCD screen you could you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curved things with it but you can you wouldn't have with the LCD you'd have the wires coming off you wouldn't have that with the with the LCD you don't have that with the printed circuit board with also sorry to interrupt I don't see why the curved thing is a problem if we for example had a shell yeah yeah you can have a flat screen inside yeah I'm just wondering whether we want an LCD screen inside it wouldn't be like full color it would just be black and white but they'd be touch touch buttons so you wouldn't be pressing down on all we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-ISON I think it would be good to have a contrast between if the whole thing rubber rubber is saying it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy yeah now how would you distinguish if you had it there how'd you distinguish where you had to press me yeah I hadn't really thought that another idea that helps with that but just to do with the RSI is it possible just as an option when we open it up people can use their fingers to press the button or we have inside like a small pointer thing yeah you could have some sort of stylus thing you could pull out but I think they could get there easily lost yeah easy to replace as well who's very often a person who switches channels very often does use a particular function very often yeah you'll find it very irritating to use yeah yeah and he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to yeah yeah if you keep punching with an point over yeah okay just just thought they wouldn't actually need one in the could you anything they've got couldn't they have pan still a pan so they wouldn't really need a okay we'll talk quite that so if you finish here yeah that yeah that's the end okay before like your distance regarding the circuit since we have having a flip top yeah customized the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top oh yeah complex buttons in the distance so we can divide the circuit like yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple I mean you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them because in the in the actual flip that you'd have some linking I just raised another point well it occurs to me it kind of applies to both our designers here not sure how it would fit in if we flip open now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs there are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display you see those and they kind of respond to the turn of your body is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it's a little compact mirror when you press a button it then goes on to the phone display the out there remote control display thing we're marketing to guys as much as we are to women I don't look at himself just a thought well it's a remote control you were sitting watching TV yeah are you gonna want to sort of open it I know what you mean so without using the ideas mobile phones are kind of got tracked onto that I think okay just trying to think of other features we can build in it wouldn't cost too much but one would be that one on the side yeah I mean you can't you could do it you could have a because if you if you just put the full charge through an LCD display or completely blank it out I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it I think we forget about the mirror that was just a very quite passing so yeah okay I would like to show something which I did here first thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility second is we checked into competitors the picture who shows what are the standard models offered by computers here so you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing teams said people need trendy they are both of black and white so you generally see rectangular shape very monotonous kind of designs here and second thing is there's too much of confusion here no particular remote is standard like some some people have here you see this this is on I found out that only common feature is the channel control and the volume control rest other buttons they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models and okay and second as already discussed with William we are going to have maybe a GUI interface in the in the middle of the flip top and graphic user interface basically which is what we do in computer have icons are touchpad over to if yeah if you have like buttons appear on the screen and the cell CD screen like you have an all icons are something you have is a good example of GUI traffic user interface so basically a person need not point or click or press any particular device he just has to click on that particular icon that is simplified and on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device that means user button so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent so we are having a combination of both so on this simpler board on the top we have this button rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels can we swap that round so the one that we use all the on the bottom part if you think about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press just like the mobile phone you don't have to flip it open and you'd be wouldn't you? not the idea if we just use the shell as an example again you open that you've got your LCD display there and you've got the buttons there she holds it that's what I was saying but you can't do it in the fun look and then have the LCD at the top and then be able to touch that for the other and you move into the volume and the program things like that and the lower the lower so the findings are too many clouded buttons repetition of certain buttons which I already explained example the volume and channel control buttons all are confusing and inconsistent of KV had a latest finding of voice recognition there was a male which mentioned that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature we have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at a low cost but for like we had response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it so it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers I am here yeah some kind of thing or it gives a blip sound some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also and technologically innovative also yeah so we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this my personal preferences would be like as already highlighted by marketing department they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say their design should be like a fruit but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors are red chili yeah two mitre right over whatever and second thing is certain certain standard buttons we should have like for example if you see the previous slide wow yeah I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this certain central pattern here yeah so we would not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls I can't see that that play and stop this is central one the one you have volume and channel so keep that standardize because that's the most common feature across all models if you look at all the models it's you this voice recognition right okay I'm not sure how long we've got left but we need to make a decision about things we discussed so we agree on do we agree on the battery yeah yeah that means that there's no function for the port you know that it sits in the impressive button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition yeah I think it's like a gadget yeah it is it is quite it's quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts are already in stock then it won't be cheap to remanufacturing or it will be cheap so to remanufacturing so do you recommend to get idea that where's the remote I'm here thing I think that would be quite fun I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost yeah that means we have to cut down somewhere else but I think pretty much we use cheap yeah to be cheap and simple thing yeah LCD's not cheap well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full color because if you just got black and white one I mean they use them in calculators maybe we could start with the black and white yeah we talked about kinetic charging we just seemed to have decided on that did we decide on double your triple batteries what you want like a backup no one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double your triple batteries because they still got to be charged this way haven't they know the kinetic one come come with the sort of watch a battery that goes in the watch right okay so it's a lot smaller so you want that okay okay got battery the inside components pretty standardized across the board yeah so there's not really a decision to be made there the buttons what did you give us the bear board LCD yeah I think we were going for the LCD on the on the on the on the top one okay you've got the touch yeah okay and then on the bottom we're gonna have to rub a rub once the anti OS islands okay okay sorry could you repeat that last part okay on the flip screen the flip screen the top one is gonna be the LCD and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberized but okay so the body design I think plastic plastic yeah okay inside for the inside and yeah rubber as a padding or for the grip something like to add to the design so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell variety of designs okay and it is just a always rubberized and spongy apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colors we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else we don't want to be tacky okay different shape anyway the fact the material that we would be using would be cheap we could make it red we could make it psychedelic you know we could make it black and white there for stripes but that's not really what we're focusing on what we're focusing on the feel yes so you just pick anything is that going to be the image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that maybe about that size made of plastic fits into the power of the hand rubberized cover that's spongy is that really going to fit fancy looking feel which was the major thing that people wanted market research is that's just different it's just different from everything else and I mean I'm trying to imagine being looking houses sort of beige and black do you either want something that goes with that which is what's on the market anyway or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than that chocolate yeah I'm just kind of pushing it that to see if you came out with anything else but I mean I totally agree we looked at those emotes I mean there are kind of anonymous very similar looking things this would definitely be different I just wanted if anybody could come up with something and you would just have a across the but you would have so many different options you could do you could have a plain black one you could have sparkly pink literally the things the rubberized covers are going to be serratively cheap to produce that if in a year's time we get feedback from the design fears that show something else is coming out it's so easy to be faster to produce that that can be slipped on and watch another beauty of it ones that have rubbery spikes you know just goes so far like a puffer face you could just you could take it wherever so I think that's quite a yeah flexible and finally the body should be detachable maybe you can change the body of the case kissing the case out it should be more loaded with the design in such a way you can change it every time yeah yeah with these rubber these rubberized okay not the actual plastic outside case just the rubber okay okay we've got five minutes um that might have been up for a while so can I just recap erasura for the decisions that we've made kinetic charging the watch type batteries LCD display on the top side of the flip top rubberized buttons on the bottom side we're going to use fruit and vegetable colors for the rubber cover the case itself is plastic that's how far we've got what else do we have to add to our decisions here we're talking of a wise recognition also because that we have not addressed the issue of how to locate remote control if it's lost yes we're just a cost issue with that but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost of maybe like William was suggesting the last thing some devices you put on key chains oh yeah yeah the whistle once so we can financially voice recognition is not visible we could go far away so and incorporating the company logo yep but we'll be incorporating on the design because I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from your report it's not just a case of having a little rr hidden somewhere they do want it to be obvious that it's our product well they do but I think we can since it's the only one of its kind on the market obviously going to be a news I think you just address that with advertising you associate the name with the individual product that it is okay and that doesn't work for you obviously you'll have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it the point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently I think it does did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper I think that was you talked about a beeper for location and we just rejected that and be the voice recognition depending on how yeah depending on the expense I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into yeah I've got in stocks that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we have to cut down somewhere else then it's worth thinking about but I think we'll find out more about yeah afterwards right going to back that day I got a end meeting now right? did it? I've been a bushing here so I think we've probably got instead of going to the thing we have 40 minutes so I think we've probably got about that time before we come back see that that or we only had 40 minutes to discuss what we've discussed I think we're pretty going in a clear direction now is everyone happy?",

The Marketing Expert made a presentation on trend watching, including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion. The Industrial Designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available. He suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials. The User Interface Designer presented his main interface design, which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the LCD screen for other functions, to keep frequently used features easy to use. He announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider, depending on price. The Project Manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design. It was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery, that the remote will feature an LCD screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons, and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available.

The case materials could be soft, rubbery, changeable. Buttons for the combination of LCD and rubber. It's designed, bright, funky designs, inspired by through keeping with the hip feel.

Okay, so this is our look and feel presentation, the final, our final presentation. And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there. It's going to have a plastic body with a sort of standard color, either with thinking of something fairly neutral. Like a white or a light blue or something. This is underneath the rubberized, the rubberized outer casing, which there'd be sort of a wide choice. They would be attached, but we can count with it. The wide choice of colors and sort of patterns. So you've got, you've got a lot of customisation with it. It's obviously in a sort of clamshell design. And the top LCD screen, you can see there would be sort of... How do you say this? It would be sort of in set into the top and the buttons at the bottom would say it's so fully closed. Flat. Oh, right. Yeah. And working on the inside with already said, decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually thinking about it now, you could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well, so that you could probably get a bit... It's a bit in the top section rather than bottom section, because it's in the top section. Yeah. We decided that the voice recognition system, they did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in, and they were fairly easy to get hold of. So we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. So you'd have something like, what you'd shout out, where is the remote, and it'll shout back, I'm here or something. And then... And then... Yeah. It won't shout out, I'm here or something. It'll just shout out, I'm here. Okay. Or something too similar. Or something too similar. Or that would be too bad. Yeah, if it was getting that... Well, that could be something for next time, maybe. You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is. The standard transmission with the TV using all the standard chips that we've talked about. It would have obviously, because it's split over two different layers, it would need two separate PCBs that would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling. And because obviously all TVs use this, the same infrared medium, we'd just be using the same thing to transmit the data. And the infrared sender would be on one of the bottom layers, just at the front of the... I don't think we actually put it on. Yeah, yeah, someone on there. It could be... Yeah, on the front, on the front side of that, yeah. All right, yeah. So even if it's open here, the thing that's on there. So when you've actually got to open it, it would be facing the TV. And then finally, on the interface, the top screen, as we said, is would be an inset black and white LCD touch screen, which... Yeah, would have all of the available functions for the remote on it. Whereas the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons, like the volume up and down, channel up and down, power on and off. And things do that effect. And now, we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have some kind of sort of bezeled logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top. But not interfering with that. No, not at all. No, not interfering with the whole look of the product when it's out on the thing. And finally, that's how we put the fashion back into electronics, as well. Thanks very much. That's a company logo. Rapping it all out. Okay. I've now got evaluation criteria. Certainly. Sort of this... The one... Sorry. Okay. Back to the screen. Back to the screen. Thank you. Oops. Sorry. What about the usual? Yeah. I think this is a little bit cheap. It's quite similar to what it was before, though. Okay. This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research. So this is the first stage of the evaluation. Now, the collection of the criteria, as we saw in our previous meeting, was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing report and marketing strategy of our company. So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting. Are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? Now, the findings that we came up with, just a recap, are here. The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy-looking feel. Technological innovation. It should be easy to use. It should incorporate current fashion trends. And those are the two main ones. They were the spongy texture. And the fruit and vegetable, strong design colors. The design should minimise our SI and be easy to locate. And we were still slightly unbivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there, but that did seem to be the favourite strategy. But there was also on the sideline the thought of maybe having a beeper function. Okay. So we can come back to that slide if you don't have a note of those. I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this, to what we have so far. We're going to use a seven point scale where one is true in seven is false. We'll look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned. I'll call that slide back up. And I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here. Does that seem clear? Any questions there? So we're going to look at these. Is it everybody's going to evaluate or just the more clear? Yes. We're going to discuss each one and we'll come to our consensus rating between one and seven. Okay. One is true, seven is false. Right. So I won't write all of that out again. It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or ABCDEF to confuse it with the number rating. This is where I realize how tiny I actually am. Just right, Farley. I'll just do a few more criteria. And rating. Actually, it might be an idea if we each did give our own a division rating and we could take an average at the end. How about that? Yeah, you're going to be okay. So I'll just separate the ratings by your bleeks and if we go one, two, three, four, we know who's here. Yeah. Okay. Criteria A, the fancy looking feel. How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy, is a fancy looking feel? One is true, seven is false. My own rating for that would be a two. One is true and seven is false. How do we do? Yeah, I'd probably put it to, yeah, two or three. No, three, three. Okay. As in, two. I would say four. Four. Okay. I think those up, we've got six and a five, eleven divided by four is what? Two and three quarter for that? Yeah. Three. Two and three quarter? I think so. Yeah. Okay. Two point seven, five. There we go. Okay. Criteria B, Criterion B, technologically innovative. I would give that a three. I'd give it a one. Not that you're biased. No, no. Not a two. The designer. A two. Oh, sorry. No, I got it wrong. The first one reading, I'm sorry. Can you just make it two? The average? Yeah, I just thought it was a... You want your rating to be a two? In A. Is that what you're saying? Yeah. I just got it. So I'll work out the average for that again at the end. It's a very slightly altered. Okay. I'm just waiting for your rating. Two point five for that. Two point five, okay. Using one decimal, please. I don't know if you're using one decimal. So you're rating for this one, pal? Two, okay. So that is eight. That brings it down to two. Two. Yeah. Okay. Easy to use. Easy to use. Based on what you've said there, I would say one. True. Two. Two. Two. I should have said a two to make the arithmetic. We'll just put almost two because we're not going to get into silly decimal places. Okay. Okay. We want to really bring it down. We can do later. Now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends. And that's particularly in relation to our market research finding about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colour. Yeah. Right. So I'm just thinking before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your approach of type here. Yeah. Is this actually going to be the colours that you choose? No, no. The base colour was like all light blue. All light blue. All light blue. But the changeable facies would allow you to get any one of the number of colours. It's full sort of custom. It's a different fruit and vegetable colour. So that's what we're going to do. Yeah. Okay. And the spongy feel is no problem with that. No, no. Because the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put around it. Okay. Otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic. In that case it's got to be a one for me. Yeah, I'll give it a one as well. Yeah. Everybody's okay. One. That part was an opening. Yeah. Okay. Moving on to, does the design minimise the repetitive strain and do you? I don't think we've really touched on that. I know. We've discussed it. We haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that. We've talked about pointers but the very use of a remote control. If you're someone who's laughing, who's sitting around, we've found so many people did. How do you minimise that such a small debate? Well the type of button that we're going to use in the bottom here, the material. The material. The mice and psaricide, menti. Mm-hmm. Maybe because it's like with the size of the guy, it's quite small but with the amount of stuff we put on it, isn't that much. Maybe because there's more space, not moving around to the accurately, the buttons in between. It's quite obvious, just big buttons. Right. I think I'm going to have to be neutral on that and give it up. Yeah. Yeah, I gave her five, I think. Four. Four. Four. Four. Four. Okay. 21, 21, so that's 4.25. Yep. And finally, last but not least, easy to locate. So we talked about voice recognition, we talked about a beeper, we really never had to come to any. Yeah, it was a voice recognition. It was the honest recognition. Yeah. And we're happy with the costs and that. Yeah, yeah, that. Cost-quires. Yeah, that was feasible. That sounds good then. I'd go for, we can adjust the volume on that just as we could volume on TV. I think you're... Something in the other room on TV's different rooms. I think it would probably be a standard, it would be quite loud. Everything. So it would be... If you didn't hear it in the room you were standing in, then you realized it wasn't in that room. Okay. And then we're going to the room. Logical. That's the one for me. Yeah, one. One. I do realise we might be being fairly biased because it is a problem. So how do we feel about this? We've got our... We've got the highest rating of meeting with specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there. That is for incorporates current fashion trends and of easy to locate. The lowest rating we've got, which is really... It's not terribly low, it's close around neutral, is for the minimisation of repetitive strain injury. Do we feel on the basis of that, of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and they produce this as a prototype and market it, or do we have to make further modification? I don't think so. I think... To go ahead and take the... Yeah. I think for most of those rating that it's high enough at the upper end of this scale for us to go ahead with that. And I really doubt it on the basis of current technology and of current capability, we could actually do much... You're marching and having a huge big... I know. Okay. And I hope that's clear to the team. Is there anything you'd like to ask me about the findings for... I'm not... No. I'm good. I know. Okay, thank you. Okay, I've got finance in there. I'm going to plug this in so you can all see it. That's okay. You want me to unblood that? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's see if this... Okay. Right. Okay. Now, I presume... That the screen will be applied. That... Okay. We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value. So, I was still on for kinetic. Yeah. Okay. So, it would have been handy to have this beginning. It might have been fun to start choice. Right. What's happening with the electronics? There's regular chip on print and... Oh, no, no, no. The... Yeah, it's... You've put in three for the number of kinetic cells. It would just be one. In the top, it's the number. Oh, right. Okay. Thanks. Yeah, and... So, would it be two? Yeah, just...no, one rig... One chip? Yeah, one of them had one sample sensor and sample speed. Okay. And they're double curves. No. One of them... Two, because it's two loads. And it's slightly flat and bottom-third. So, what's a single curve? Yeah, I'd say... It's one bottom with one curve. Yeah, I think it's... So, just one double curve. Yeah. And what, no, because one... Yeah, one's double curved and then the other one is... Yeah, that's the size, but it's slightly flat and the bottom sort of... Plastic. Plastic and rubber, probably. Yeah. So, let's take one and make a double point curve. Yeah, I like it. I think rubber, since it's being used just as a casing, we can put 0.5. Yeah. You think? Yeah, because there are... I think it allows the 0.5 here. We can use that. Yeah. Okay. What does it mean if you put 0.5? Yeah. Means, we are not using a lot of rubber, actually. We're using... We're using a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic. See, it says case material. So, we're not actually using plastic in the case. No, no, it's as an extra. It's including, it's my thing. So, that shouldn't be actually on there, because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get. But it is going to be part of the total cost and there's nowhere else we can put that in, is there? There's nowhere else we can code for the rubber used in the casing. So, do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there? Okay, we'll just put it in as... We'll put it in as half. Okay. We should just put it in as one, because plastic is either anyway. Yeah, okay. Okay, special colour, do you believe that night do? We're going for some of the more exotic rubber jeans and such light colour. Interface. Push button. Yeah, the push buttons, one and LZ display one. One button. You I think we could change the battery also. So, we're going for kind of, how we're going for a standard battery. Is that not made any, if you click off that square now, I mean any difference. Was that on the front line? On the front line? On the front line? On the front line? On the front line? On the front line? On the front line? On the front line? Yes, I want to make a difference. On the gold flat. Oh, it's not made any difference, right? No, well... It's not again, it's just right as well. No, no, you've got to click off to calculate it again. Okay, there we go. It's going to go slightly. It might... It's not so. You might be assuming that that is in Euros, it could be in dollars. And then, would be fine, because the exchange rate may get a bit... Is it having, I don't know... I think we haven't been dealing with dollars there, I think. Right, I think it's a new one. Okay, so the highest we've got is the electronics here. If we turn the interface... If we moved away from our much-loved idea of a kinetic battery... I'm just going to do a number of batteries without making a huge difference. Yeah, the standard... We would make one difference. The biggest one would be taking away, if he took away. What I feel is, customers never said anything about the battery. It's internal, nobody looks into the battery. Yeah. But shape and color, that's something... If you take away the voice... I don't like that, but if you take away the voice recognition, then you've got it. Voice that's a special problem. Do we see what difference it may? Where is the... Yeah, no, because... Where's the voice recognition? It's samples, sent to sample speaker. Right, I can... If you take away that, they'll make it 12.35. Well, the kinetic is 3. If we change it to the battery, that's minus 3. Yeah, but you minus 3 plus 2. All right. We can do it some other way. It doesn't have to be voice recognition. We could do the voice recognition for business class or something. Like an upgraded version. No, you could choose to have a lot. But I mean, I don't see why we have to set up 25 years now, because they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for a better product. But we're still working to... So should we just change the size of the application? Headeye specification, then. In our recommendation. If we're working to head off the specifications... This is what this project is working for. We can put in our recommendations for what we've found and what the consensus that we've come to is a job. We need to work to that specification to start with. Yeah, we can think. The voice recognition sounds wonderful, but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is going to make it easier to locate, as you know, in our first instance. As you say, we can offer the voice recognition initiative to business class customers. Okay, we can make the price fit and then say... And then say, we recommend... We would have had this because it also sets apart. Because we don't have a background where they like their gadgets. They want to like something that's completely different. Yes. Because someone can be different, associated with your company. Right, okay. So if we take voice recognition, I... I spelled it... 12.35. Yeah. Is it 12.50? Two-sided. Is it 12.50? No, it's 12.25. Are you sure? Sorry, not meaning to doubt your wallet. Yeah, it's 12.25 times two years. 25. Are they going to be really critical about 10p? 9.01 over euro. Which is less than 10p. I don't know what... It's said 50% is a cost. So half of the price is... Where the price was, isn't it? What is the first one? That's today. 12.5? Oh, so we are another one. So we are okay. So, has that got us covered for the electronics then? We don't need something else to take that place. No. Okay. Because that was just bolt on X-ray. You could just take that out. And it would be fine. Okay. It seems fine. Yeah, I think it's pretty good. Thanks for voice recognition, everything is... Right. Done, man. Okay. Product evaluation. We've done room for creativity, haven't we? Yeah. We've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't. Didn't feel able to make. A presumably discussed leadership in teamwork? Yes. Yeah. In the sense that... Did you feel like a team or did you feel like? All right. I think it was a nice team. I think it was a nice team. There was so much interaction, so much that we needed to... Find out from each other. And I've certainly felt heard, listened to, and that in relevant areas we've been able to give and take. And I just are a remit for an SSO. Yeah, I think it is a very constructive feedback by everybody. It's not like people trying to cut each other. It is more of a through cohesive teamwork. We came to a very pretty creative design. Yeah. And... Yeah, I think, and Sarah, you coordinated the work very well. Thank you. How did you find it? Yeah, no, I thought it went really well. And I, yeah, I felt everyone was listening to you. And all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out. They didn't quite make the voice recognition in there, but that's good. Yeah. I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually. If we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out, I think maybe it would have come out a little different. Yeah. I like the fact that we could say an idea, and it'd be suggested that there wasn't the best idea, but no one felt like a short time. Yeah. You know, it didn't matter saying what you got, because if it wasn't something that was that relevant, then it didn't matter, it was just another idea. Yeah. And teamwork, well, you two created that wonderful specimen of a play-doh model. Yeah. I think that was the best part of that. I'm still not caught up, but that's nothing to do with teamwork at all. Maybe we should think of branching it into children's toy, fake mobile phones, the provide one. The fake one. Yeah, that was quite fun. It means whiteboard digital pens, etc. What if that means? I have to be allowed to evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information. Yeah. Could it have been better? Was it adequate? Yeah. I think we probably would have used the Azure E-Mouse system more. Had we actually had time to kind of... Had more time, and if we'd been separated more... Yeah, because we could just sort of say, sorry, what do you say about that, or what do you think about that, rather than having to invent it? Yeah. But it was nice having it there. Like the whole picture of the thing. Yeah. But it's like moving around the room. I think it's good. Like we spend times individually... I never thought of a remote control with a flip top. Yeah, I think it's... Actually, following from other areas, it's bringing things from other areas in. I mean, nothing in the mean. But it's applying it to a different area. That's the most. That's mine. Yeah. Yeah, no. Well, they have to come from somewhere. Absolutely, yeah. And as... As what, sorry. Yeah, sorry, that's fine. And as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls, no one's thought about it, particularly. I mean, there's slightly differences. Someone's been shot in a room and said, make ours a bit different from everyone else's, or something we should think about. But obviously, no one's putting a great deal of sign into it. I don't think the companies are really concerned. They're just like, we've got a DVD player. Does anyone remember their own control? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one? Yeah, just jazz it up for it. They don't really think about it, because normally the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship. They're trying to ship the DVD player, the video, the TV. But then when everything is really smart. Yeah. And you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table. Doesn't go in if you could have something that's a proper, funky thing, a funky item, that's individual. Individual to you. I mean, they could even go into... You go in with an idea. A nail designer on Photoshop. And then they just get it printed on the plastic. You would pay a lot extra because it's individually being plastic, it was being made for you. But people could even have anything that they wanted. Surprising to me is like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones. Like every month you see a new launch or something like that. And new television products coming up. But nobody giving a much idea to this. I think this has been very market research-based. Because just going back to mobile phones. I mean, this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really say is it's obvious and visible. We see it in mobile phones a lot. And that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ideas from. There are innovations in that that people don't really want. I see people wanting a model of the phone that we're really happy with and they can't get it anymore. It's innovation for innovation's sake. And I think it's wonderful that our companies, so R&D based... Well, it's innovation for money's sake. The people have to keep it. They might want to buy the thing they've been doing. And you can't get... You've got your hands at the work's fine, but you can't get battery anymore for that type of phone. It's the phones have moved on. Things like that. There's a covetificent of that. In closing... Our costs are blow budget with recommendations for the budget being increased. But I think... I don't know... What do you think? Do you think that takes into account overheads like us being well paid for everything? And the heating for the building. Do you think our budget includes everything all the costs that are going out? I think it was just the product... I think that was just the physical. So it looks... Well, it looks like it's going to be 50% profit. It's still gone. All of the overheads might have been. So maybe increasing it... You would also have to increase the price of the 8. So, I don't think... Yeah, I think... But you were saying that that's quite... I think in the review... I can even think of a review... It's very specific. I think we've done what we required to do. And I think like the other project team or any project we're looking at, those kind of things... I don't think that's something we have to look at. And underweigh the couch for. Yeah, it was... We've done very well to get within budget. It still makes such an innovative item. Yeah. I think people are really going to want to shame it more than we ever get. Maybe they're going to steal our ideal. It's a top secret. What is this conspiracy going on here? The project has been evaluated well and true to you. And we've got the meeting summary in question here. There's a fine question. So we've got about 50 minutes to catch up with everything that I've found by the way. So I'll be delegating it. I am... In your last project, supervising. So good luck. Celebration. You didn't talk about that. I think that celebration is a 25-time. That will be dancing on the dance. Okay. What's that all about? Yeah, just the last, I think. Awesome. I think I've got minutes for two of the meetings. And the last thing is to have done. But I didn't have to rate you on how much you're influenced the meeting with time. Is that not the question after how you've done in your thing? I'm right. But do we not sometimes evaluate the meeting? Yeah, there it is. I think, yeah, question after seven is so I'm going to pull the meeting. Yeah. I just got to...",
        "abstract": "The Project Manager went over decisions from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer presented the prototype and discussed its look, its internal components, and its interface. The Marketing Expert evaluated the product according to the initial product goals. The group then decided that enough of this criteria had been satisfied for the project to continue. The Project Manager presented the final cost of the device which exceeded the initial projected price point. The group decided to remove speech recognition but to propose to the management that it  remain in the design. The group then discussed their effectiveness as a team. All members felt that they interacted well and that they felt they could be creative. The Marketing Expert felt that the market-research based approach would help the project's success with consumers. The group did express, however, that the budget was overly constraining. The Project Manager instructed the group to fill out a final evaluation questionnaire.",

It was removed when the project exceeded its initial budget, but it will be suggested to the management that the speech recognition should remain in the product design. The plastic case will be a neutral color, and the changeable rubber cases will be available in vibrant, fruit colors. The LCD screen will appear only in black and white. The company logo will appear on the inside of the device when opened. The group decided that the device fulfilled enough of the project's initial goals to continue in production.",

        "transcript": " making a profit of 50 million euros. So it's going to have to be pretty out-candy. All your remote controls I use usually come with the television. Yeah, fairly basic. Yeah, I was thinking that as well. I think the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type thing. Yeah, the Universal ones. So presumably that might be an idea too. But the source. 25 new lot of neat features. Yeah. Yeah, because I mean what? The 25 euros that's about 15 pounds or so. And that's quite a lot for a more control. Well, my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black as you said they come with a TV so it's normally just your basic grey black remote controls as a function. So maybe we could think about colour. That might make it a bit different from the rest at least. And as you say, we need to have some kind of gimmick. So I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle, you know that? Like the key right? Because we always lose our own child. Yeah, right. Okay, let's go. Yeah, being as a marketing expert I would like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or and other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices? What specialty our remote controls are having? And how complicated it is to use this remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market? So before deciding or before finalizing this project we must discuss all these things. Like and apart from this, it should be having a good look also. Because people really like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their CD player, MP3 player like any electronic devices. They really want to have something good having a good design in their hands. So yes, all this. What is the thing for? Oh, okay. What do we think the size would be for this? Sorry. Because as you add more buttons to their mode sometimes it gets so big and clunky. Yeah. There's just like a hundred buttons on it. Or you could have a really small slim one but they can lose it easily. They need to lose it, yeah. Kind of maybe more like a pda kind of just handhelds like. For a member of trying to make it for 12 years, 50. Yeah. No, sorry, I was thinking of the screen. Okay, well, we'll have to, we're having an army in a half an hour. So we're still looking to a bit, right, actually, no, well, I'll keep. So you do the looking around at other remote controls. Yes. If you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever. And you could look into basically how it's made. I like how you make it all in one. How what sort of materials are available to you, whatever. And obviously other instructions have come from the personal code. Right. Which are probably just dessert-wise. So you want me to look at shapes and everything. Shapes and colors. Okay. Basically how to make it attractive. Design. And you make it competition. Yeah. Do they? Go. Okay. So we have wait for emails. Okay. Okay, grimy. And now that we'll get, I know, I'm sorry. We'll get warnings for next meetings as well. Okay. Cool. Okay. So, I can't imagine these methods. So I'll be the one to okay. Okay. Yeah. Oops. Okay. Okay. Let's go. I guess I'm going to have to do. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

        "transcript": " It's from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on rules for each of you. However, there are some changes that I've got from on high that are a bit there. What I didn't actually realize was that this is for a specific television. So they're all in one idea because I don't know. And they require that they... I'll get to that as you see it's point number four. And we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we're going to do from it. So presentations, were you... Anybody got? Yeah. Wearing to go. I need to plug you in. I'm not just a... It's a... inspired design. Do you want me to move? I'm just going to... I'm going to swap the lines. I'm going to... With function f8. f8. Let's see, we blew one of the hearts. Sorry, f8. Should do it. Yeah. Me again, Raj as a marketing expert. As we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out. Someone's fine. If you just go ahead. Actually, sorry. I have to see the other sounds. Sorry. Yeah, thank you. Yes, I have to look at the market potential for this product. And like consumer liking and everything. What is the potential for this product? And are we able to achieve this our net profit or our aim? So, note. Then... Press f5. Sorry. Okay. Yeah, I can... Okay. Then the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey. A detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their liking and disliking. But they prefer, but they note preferable. What problems they do encounter in all these types of things. And what we got first, we found that. Thank you. But they... What problems they are having with the grant remote controls available in the market? 75% of users, they find that the remote controls available in the market are ugly. They are not so good looking. So, we have to put stress on this. We have to take care of this factor also like our design should be appropriate, should be good looking for the consumers. And yes, this will definitely... This can definitely put in house our sales. And even the good thing about this is that 80% of users, they are willing to pay more for this good looking remote controls also. So, even if the available market cost for the available remote control is less, even then we can sell it at 25 euros, which may seem quite high. But if our looks are... If the remote control we design have a better look, better designs, then we can hope that consumers will prefer these remote controls. And the second thing, some companies think that they should have more and more functions of the users in their remote controls. But rather than those having more functions in the remote controls, we should emphasize what actually consumer wants, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated. Because mostly it has been found that 50% of the users, they use only 10% of the buttons. So, there is no fund of having 90% buttons making the remote controls too bulky, too complicated, too expensive. And because I think I believe that technologies use will only if the consumers they want to use it. Otherwise, there is no fund of having all this type of thing. So, this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls, but it will increase our profit also. So, we have to take care of this factor also. It was function I want to go. Oh, you are going to go back just to escape. Then, if we look at this slide, these are your shared documents, you can see. I was just going to say what was the question for us. Are you coming onto that? Look at the market potential. But how we should design our remote controls, what it should be there. So, as to enhance our profit. So, these are different age group persons. Sorry, I cannot open it. Speechwork here. If we look at the cost, whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in their remote control or not, we can find that the up to a 35 year age group, we have a very good disliking for this point like for speech recognition in their remote control. So, we can emphasize on this point also like because it will definitely enhance our sales in this particular age group from 15 to 35. And I think that most of the users of the TV are belong to this age group. We should look at who buys it as well. Yeah, we can look at that factor also. Which other 25 to 35 is usually. If we look at this data, how what are the problems because the owners are facing with the existing remote control in the market? They find that 35% of the consumers they find too difficult to operate in remote control. So, it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide proper manuals, fights use also. So, as that consumers could easily learn and need not to have any much technical knowledge to see to know how to operate these remote control. So, this is also a very major factor to take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales. So, this is all about market potential by me. Yes. Okay, thank you. Following with Helen? Yep, sure. That's cool. Oh, so we do. One of the games. That's it. The cable's going to be longer. I just can't get over whatever runs or underneath. I have this one outside. Okay. Thank you very much. Before it's me to help. Yeah. Okay, and then what do I press F8? F8. Function F8. Alright. Okay, cool. It's not coming out. Function F8, okay. Yeah. Yeah, no signal. Okay. There you go. Computer. Okay. Okay, and then how do I press the big one to get it on to the F5? F5 and I press that again to get it all. F5 and the cable bring it back and just the left button for advancing. Okay, so I'm the interface designer user interface. I'm concerned with what effect the operator should have on the user. And I'm also, I want to point out that our motto put the fashion in electronics. So obviously, as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable. It's a big concern about it. Okay. And how do I press the next button? Just the left there. Okay. Left. So I looked at existing designs and also the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like, what people thought this like. And what people fashionable because we said people between 25 and 35 were the main buyers of our TV, I think. So what they like and what they find fashionable and ergonomics research. I don't know, I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself, but maybe that comes up, I don't know. And the findings, well, that was a basic function, send messages to the television set. That's what people want to do. So they need to be included. But I've got some pictures here of some leading ones. I don't know how to get some. If you're a scape, then you can see your bar. Oh, okay, cool. I've got my glasses. So I hope it fits on. These are two leading remote controls at the moment. You know, they're gray. I mean, this one's got loads of buttons. It's hard to tell from here what they actually do. And they're in, very exciting at all. Personally, I prefer this one just because it looks easier to use. It's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff. But there you go, that's what we're up against. And I think we can do much better than that. I hope so. Hang on. Okay, sorry. Personal preferences. Well, I think we need to, I think the ergonomics is quite important. Particularly, there was a bit in the RSI and things as well. And I thought not too edgy and like a box more kind of handheld more. Not as a computer and organic. Organic, more organic shape, I think. Simple designs. Like the last one we just saw, not too many buttons. And as a Raj pointed out, only 10%, 50% of people only use 10% of the buttons. So I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how nice it is. Hand held and portable, I think, is important. Because TFT have just released, I think, is it a remote control for presentations or in the big screen anyway. So, yeah, anyway, so handheld and portable. And I thought about other functions for TV, but as you pointed out, people don't actually want that. And also the company wants to keep it stuck to the TV for, to keep them stuck to the TV. It's the one TV. Oh, right, okay. Sure. And so the last thing I thought, which I quickly mentioned in the other one, was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people, like blowing the dark. Perfect. Which, it does already exist, but it's not very widely used. I think easy finder with a whistle function or something, or rechargeable station because it's pain when you run out of batteries. And I think that, yeah, that's it. That's cool. So I know it's for talk about speech recognition and whistling. And I just curious now, have we done any research into how many people can whistle? Or is that a function we want in the remote? Do you have trouble with the... I don't, but I know a lot of people do. Really? Yeah, it just... I mean, it has to be a certain kind of whistle TV. Yeah, it's a whistle, it's true. But you could have the... You could have the basically instead of a whistle, if it's got the voice recognition, you could have it just, you know, where are you? Yeah. It's costly though. Much easier thing is just any loud noise, like clapping, shouting, you know. And then, would the response be a beep, a back and you, or something? Yeah, something. Okay. Well, I said this up. So plug it in, press F5. Function F5? Function F8 for the function F8. Yeah. Not that. I need to twit over the thing you've got to think. I think it's just lacking in. It's good. Okay. As the industrial designer, my job is to take an input from you guys. So it's good you went first. And I jotted down some notes as to what are the needs. And we'll kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others. Siraj told us that consumers are going to spend more for fancy products. And you also mentioned that the current products don't always match users operating behavior. A lot of the buttons aren't used. And I mentioned that they're not fun to use. And a novel feature, which you just brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature. For when you lose your remote, there could be a little microphone on it. And any noise over a certain threshold, it'll pick up as a distress signal from you. And I'll be back and say, no, here I am. Surely that would have to be specific rather than above a threshold. Because if you had a live movie on you, like, they get it. Oh, yeah. You could pick back at you. Well, maybe you could have a, that would be a consideration taking the count. Sorry, didn't mean to do anything. Yeah, well, that's for later down the road. And then as for the user interface, it should be trendy. I'm not computer, so more low tech and not too many buttons. So I took these on to consideration. And also I have some limitations from the boss. And practical limitations, which I kind of threw out the window. And so I did a little research. And unfortunately, all I had to work on was our corporate archives of the great products we've made before, which include spacecraft, coffee makers, and bullet trains. Oh, is that what they are? Or high speed trains. Right. And having personally worked with all these products, I have a great deal of experience with the industrial design. If you can build spacecraft, you'll have no problem with our control. I figured just put them all together. We had a caffeine-powered space shuttle train transport to your TV. And as for the user interface problem, you know, too many buttons. Give it one button. And it's through the cowboy and all of us. I'm not quite sure what the function is there. Well, I like that design. I mean, you could have a... Is that just switches on the speed recognition that it's entirely speech-operated? So I think I missed the budget thing. It was 50 million euros. And we got to solve 25 of them. Yeah. Not a problem. I know. It's 50 million euros. We've got... They've got fixed. We've got fixed. We've got fixed. We've got fixed. So we're making that at 12 and a half. You know what I was saying? Well, I guess more realistically than. We need a product that's got some kind of nifty outer casing, cheap plastic. You know, that should be just like a 10 to the price maybe or less. An energy source, which would probably just be your regular batteries. Okay. Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea? Is that... Or a little bit of a stationery. Yeah. Yeah. We could do that too. Hand-bounded. Yeah. That might cost more there because obviously with batteries, we don't need to provide... Or we provide the first batteries there. Yeah. It's more... It does cheaper. I mean, if you think about these base stations though, it's essentially just a lead with a... So self-connecting brake. So... Right. Okay, I'll press that. The unit is... Okay. The user interface, the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons. But since we're a cutting-edge company, we of course will have alternatives like speech recognition, whistling recognition, and rocket power. Okay. And lastly, the transmission interface is just some engineering thing. You don't have to worry about that. Okay. So here's a great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me. As you can see, the remote control have parts and those parts, like that. And so we've got an operating procedure that looks something like that. And as opposed to you all know how it works because we've all used it. And we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were. Personal preferences, I think, programmable options, which just require a small amount of memory, non-volatile memory, just... So the user can put in their favorite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings that when it turns it on, it's not blasting. That's a good idea, actually. I like the performance of the option. Yeah, you do. And the bells and whistles that we mentioned, you know, take more budgeting, more technical expenditure of effort. And it's also much more likely to not work if we add these bells and essays. Yeah. So all I got. Okay, thank you very much. I'll take that back. Yeah. Right, also. So, you know what I said, got not very long before we think so. Didn't manage to forward onto you is, let's say I'll find it for some. Okay. I think it needs to go in there. Just push. Yeah. We had that to disinclute telltext because it's become outdated. And it's a little bit more complicated than it is. And it's the same. And it's only for this television, which I'm presuming means it's for specific television. Okay. And instead of colors and sort of color options, they want corporate color and slogan, somehow implemented the new design. I presume everything, all this sort of, you know, the corporate website and everything's yellow. And the local, sort of slogan, we put the fashion and electronics. I don't know exactly how to incorporate. I mean, I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape, you could kind of have it working as we're going to. Where am I? Okay. So we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have. Now we had as listed options, we had speech recognition, potentially, flat screen interface, LCD interface. We also want to limit their number of buttons. So we'll pretty much take that one as red. We'll use the basic functions for our television, no teletext. Although the danger with that is it could look a bit cheap. Not enough buttons, you mean the head. So strike a balance between a few. It looks like we're just cutting on the number of buttons. I do, however, have this from over my head. Okay. They don't want teletext on it. Okay, cool. Maybe, Raj, you could find out what people would think about that. I'm going to be the same information about that. What people, other people would require teletext option in their own look. Okay. So I take it your position now, always that. The bells and whistles we've got come up with a gimmick, but not too complicated. Yeah. So I mean, the sort of incline I'm getting from a little bit of web channel I'm getting sent is that are quite interested in a TFT display, interactive display. However, that does say in a bit like the more complicated design that Raj has very Raj said people didn't like you. Although I guess if there's a thing about standard interfaces that people use already, like Windows style, drop down menus, or whatever, I think maybe that's a bit. Going a bit far, but in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons. And if you hit that menu at the top, you have, it goes to a different selection of buttons. So it keeps it simple. Going the dark is that with a light inside it, or is it going the dark material? Glowing the dark material I was thinking. So I guess that would be cheap. I'll see something about this. I think it's really, really very important point, if we look at the market, because people more 50% people they find that the mode controls are often low somewhere in the room. But from last. Yeah, are low. And means they forget where they have kept in mode control last time. But if we add speech recognition as well as glowing the dark, and both these factors will help them locating their mode control. Like if they come and speak something and the mode control replies to something, something, and it glows in the dark. Both these factors, both these points will help them to locate where they have kept this remote control. And this will definitely enhance our market sales. So we should take it into consideration also. Okay. Okay. Well, speech recognition will take it. I don't have no products. There was a much control. There was a much control. It came out two years ago that had some basic speech recognition on it. You could program it with your channels and then say, you know, the BBC one. And it goes to that channel. Yeah, it didn't work very well though, because of this noise and reference problem. And they mentioned, you know, if the television says you are listening to the BBC one. Or an advert for BBC two or BBC one will switch the channel for you, kind of. Right, right. And so there's a lot of this. You'd be watching the TV and then all of a sudden it pick up a noise and turn it off or turn the volume off or something. But if you can work around that noise problem. Well, what about this might get a bit too expensive actually, but what about something that's built into the TV that you can press and it'll send out a little signal. You know, like the ones that we can't hear or something. That will activate the remote control. So like a kind of backwards remote control. Yeah. And then they do just, you know, subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise. What you could do then would be you have a remote control by the TV speaker. I'm sorry, a microphone by the TV speaker and the transmitter there. It sends back to your mode because you can't expect the television manufacturers to put that feature into the device. Yeah, that's the only thing. Yeah, then you have like a little separate module by the computer. It just comes with our remote control. Right. And then the remote control will know what's being produced by the TV. So it'll be basically. Right. And frequency. So it'll be cheap. Right. Right. Yeah, that's certainly possible. And another thing is about this losing their mode and trying to find it again. If you do have this sort of speech interface to it, you don't even need to find it. You just say, you know, whatever you want the remote for, you know, to change a channel. Or to turn the TV on and off. You just shout your command to it and do it for you. If it's within, you know, within hearing range. And you know, it could be somewhere in the room. You have no idea where it is. And it still does jump. That could also be built into the TV. The average might make our room a bit obsolete. Yeah. Well, hopefully we'll do a set of a jaw. A head of the earth. Okay. Okay. I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing. So I think rather than, and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working very well and things like that. And they're expensive. Yeah, and expensive at the time. So I think if we're going to go well, I mean, like to think about the problem with the TFT or the LCD kind of thing is if you're also wanting the kind of organic globbies or feeling to it. Then you might have trouble incorporating screen. But I guess not. I just pretend that's not the problem. And how are you about the blur in the dark and feels? Maybe not even all of it because we said colors and fashion were important. So maybe just like a little line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest. Yeah, the materials cheap, but it's just the, the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it. So if you're sitting in the dark for too long, it won't go long. Or if it's down under the catch cushions. It's pretty easy to find mine. Okay, well, we can use, we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick, essentially. Because what I thought made, if we're going to have to have a logo on as well, bright yellow logo in a slogan. Then, you know, they're going to be fairly bright and colored anyway. And you can have sort of a trimming as well. Just a gimmick. Yeah, more than finding it, that was more like, you know, if you're watching a film in the dark. You can still see the record. All right, so that was more of it. If we're going to go with the idea of feedback, the more finder, then that kind of stuff that one over. You think it makes it fairly unnecessary. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so we've got, we want to go with the TFT idea. Is there a getting quite a few trends now? I think, I think there's sort of finder things. I mean, it's a good pull, but we're right. The circuit diagram, that was out. I think our consideration too is that these remote get abused a lot. And we get thrown around. Is a good chance that the TFT screen would break or get damaged. They're pretty fragile. So is that one of our definite requirements that they needed to do? No, I mean, we were, that was going on rather just sort of marking research, I guess. So stick with sort of programmability for the buttons that we do have. So that's sort of included in your sub module kind of stuff. You're finding out by tell text. Are you good for that? That little speech recognition? I think we're going to scratch this speech recognition as a bit of a, expensive. No, no, it's much cheaper than the TFT. It's just a mic, okay. Some integrated circuits. It'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system. All right, okay. Well, that kind of takes back the RF remote sort of idea as well. I did it. Okay. Decisions. Who wants TFT? No one does. Excellent. So we've got this speech recognition, yeah? Yes. The speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design. And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down enough of falling at my head? Programmability. Glow in dark. Yeah. If it's not a takes sense, I think it's a good game. Okay. And also integrating the member to integrate the logo and the slogan. Okay. So can you put all these reports in the project documents folder? I don't know already in there as well. So it just helps me. Yes. Someerized here. And I'm putting anything I do in there anyway. And where is it, sorry? Project documents on, so it should be when you say my scenario controller on your desktop. So go say that. Oh, is it in shared documents? And then that little folder up there. Project documents. Yeah, it's on your desktop. All the way up. That's the desktop. That's the then project documents. I can't. Hmm. It does not give me anything. Just that, that's it. And I will try to get strings of information. I'll try forward any specific to anybody in particular, as soon as I get them out of them. I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting and then meeting turn up. Did you get my email? I did. Thank you. Okay. What I thought was about the material is maybe not this kind of material, maybe more like this kind of rubbering materials, a bit more bouncy. Like you said, they get tucked around a lot. A bit more durable. And that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all other American controls. The rubber. More surf. Flash like the plastic. Wow. But we have to take care of life. But we have to take care of children also if they, means if children catch out of your life, they should be too harmful. So whatever material we use. Oh no. Yeah. It's funny. We have to safety point of view also. We have to take care. I think with, with the more organic shape that it won't be as good as how many sharp corners is that. I think it's good. I don't know. Where's my girl? She smells good for children. We have to police the other box and make the thing a big red ball, foam ball. So I think they need some. There's no buttons at all. It's always on and just yell at it. That's a good idea. Yeah. So it's going to have to be a big yellow. Oh yellow. Yeah. With the color, does it have to be all yellow? Please God know. Well, I wouldn't, I mean, my reaction to an all yellow or more control wouldn't be anything other than horror. So I think just having it surrounded the logo. It's more yellow strip or yellow square. It's a logo in it. Yeah. Okay. I'll see if I can argue with the boss about putting the, what is it? We put, we put the fashion into, oops, I'm not working. I can't believe I forgot the one. We put the fashion in electronics. Oh yeah, it's a good one though. Yeah. About that I'll catch on around. Okay, Annie, last. Where is Kitty? Top 30. Okay. I know what you're thinking. Okay, that's great. Okay, that felt a bit more like something with the order and the reason to it in the last one. Wow. Does anybody press the K? It's my break. Yeah. Pretty cool. Yeah. Pretty cool. Why are you from the very first page? Yeah. I was just writing like the page. I've got more I think. Yeah, I've been using up pages. I don't want to wait. Yeah. So I finished the meeting then. Oh, every question. Oh, every question. Yeah. Did you do? Did you do?",
        "abstract": "The Marketing Expert presented requirements of users as found in a company market study. The study showed that users want a fancier-looking but uncomplicated remote control, and are interested in speech recognition. He presented the age groups polled and said that the target marketing group should be users aged fifteen to thirty-five. The User Interface Designer presented several competitors' remotes and discussed the features that would make their own device more user-friendly. The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on important internal components that would keep the project within its budget, and discussed possible materials and programmable features. The Project Manager gave several new requirements for the project to the group. The group discussed the features they would like to incorporate into the design in light of the new requirements and budget constraints. They decided to keep speech recognition as one of their components, and decided to include some programmable features, limit the number of button functions, and make the remote yellow and glow-in-the-dark, in an organic shape. The Program Manager said that he would ask to what extent the company motto had to be incorporated into the design.",

        "transcript": " Every time I do something I forget. Right time attached, I'm here. Here? Yeah. Excuse me. We are... The meeting will have the same format as the last time, so same as much switching over up just left and went first to screens day. I have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time. Okay. Cool. And... Is there any questions you have for the right from last meeting? The particular monitoring. No, I don't think so. Okay, cool. Then we shall start with a presentation from that. Yeah. Hi, Miraj again. In this meeting I'm going to discuss about the trend watching. How this trend is going to affect our market potential and how important is this? So we have to look on this. First of all, methodology. The methodology to find out the trend was done in a way. We have done a recent, not only recent remote control market survey, but we also considered the latest fashion trends of the market. Because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit. So what are our findings? In our findings, we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey, we found that people do have preference for the fancy remote controls, which look and feel very good rather than having a functional look and feel good. So this clearly indicates their preference for the design, their outlook of their remote controls. So we should consider this factor as the most important factor. Because this factor is twice as important, the second factor which is further, the twice as important as the third factor. So this factor becomes the most important factor in our mark, means in designing our remote controls. The last one is the most important one. No, the first one is the outlook of the mobile. It should have a fancy outlook, a fancy design. Rather than just having a functional look and feel good, it should have a fancy look and feel good. The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically innovative. We must have some technological advancement in the remote control rather than just putting it as it is as the other remote controls are. So it should be technologically innovative, like glow in the dark or speech recognition, something like that. So that indicates our technological advancement. The third most important aspect to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use. Like it should have too much complicated, there shouldn't be too many buttons on this remote control. It should have too complicated like this way. And customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language, something so that they could know how to use these remote controls. When we did fashion, our recent fashion update shows that I'm not sure if it's a good one. How do I know how to incorporate that? Yeah, we have to, because you can see how people have related their close shoes and furniture, everything with fruits and vegetables. The world is now changing its strength to our organic, becoming more and more organic, becoming a big sponge. Yeah, that's very good. Something like that we should do. People, the feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look hard look. That's good. That's what I was thinking. So that they could play with it while handling it. That should also be taken into consideration. These are my views. The spongy, not real spongy. It could be like rubber when we get it. The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable, that we can take into. It shouldn't be any harm to the environment also, because our company is very, very reputable for taking all these concerns into consideration. So we don't want to have any harm to the society. Okay. That's all. I think I'll find out when I think of that. I remember it from the control. Yeah. Next year, whether any factors that weren't important in the survey, that they said we don't want to find out any such points. Yes, there could be, but we couldn't find out any. So what is it? Function, I think. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You said just. No. You think no. Is that undae? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then F5, right? Okay. Okay. So the interface concept. Yeah. The interface specification. What people, how they interact with it, basically, I think. So the method we looked at existing designs, one of the, what's good about them, what's bad about them. And looked at their flaws. We're going to look at their flaws and everything. And what the survey told us and what we think would be good. So a bit of imagination. The findings. I've got some pictures to show you. Yeah. Okay. So most remote control is these graphical interface where you have got buttons. And you point it rather than having the output as a stream of text or something. And we're also found that there's inconsistent layout which makes it confusing. So I think there are remote control. There is some inconsistency already in existing between remote controls, but I think the standard kind of. Shape and play and those kind of buttons like the top right for on and off. Something I think you find that important because then it's easy to use. And we've got some pictures of some newer remote controls to show you. Do I press escape? F5. And just escape. Escape. Okay. Oh, I see. I'm going to clap for you as well. Yeah. Okay. So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones. I'll just talk you through them. This one is voice recognition. And that's the kind of idea we're going for. There's an LCD thing which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us. This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse which. Yeah. Okay. But I'm not actually sure how you'd use that like. Like scroll. I think the right one. I've got something in front of a monitor. You scroll it and then when you reach the sort of. Manure it and that you require you press. That's like the LCD one. Is it? Okay. But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side. But I presume that the functions must come up on the TV screen. Yeah. I think that's what that is. So these are just a few I did. Again, that's just quite boring shape. Gray looks quite space-adjee but too many buttons I think. And that one. It looks like something else. Yeah. It does look kind of dangerous. This one I thought was really cool. It's got the programability function that we talked about. You can put it in there. It's for your kids and it's quite an organic shape. And the little circle around there is pretty cool. And that's really easy to use. I like this one a lot for our design. I think something like that would be good. Of course, yeah. I mean the one thing I think about it, but these ones is these secured areas. I've seen a lot of them with the cover of the missing. So I can have it heading. Yeah, that's true. So maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the TV or something. And this one, the oversized one. I don't know about you, but I think it's a bit too gimmicky. I don't think that will sell. Or is that not sort of to assist the blinders on things? I guess so. I don't know. I think that's a bit... Fine, don't watch TV. Exactly. Maybe it wasn't too. Yeah. And this one is just pointing out. I like some of these things. The raised symbols and everything, but it's pointing out that this one, the volume, it's kind of pressing down, but it would actually go up because of the shape. So that's a bit confusing. But the buttons on this, I think, is just showing you how you can have different buttons. I don't have to be all the same. So that's quite cool. But people tend to recognize certain shapes to do certain things. Yeah, exactly. So there is some of the findings. So we need to combine those ones. And I've just got an email from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in. Yeah, it is. Just in time, very handy. So I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good. You program it like you say record and then play and then record playing machine and stuff like that. So that's and it's much. Yeah. So that's quite cool. Person preferences, just some imagination. The raised symbols, I feel good. The LCD. It does look smart, but I think maybe for our budget, do you think that would be a bit too expensive? Expensive to have the LCD. Yeah. And the other stuff. And the speech recognition. I think we're definitely going for speech recognition. But in our market survey, we have seen that people are willing to pay more. But they want the quality. They want fancy. Look, they want some new design, something new. Uh-huh. Not budget. Yeah. So even if we increase our course a little bit within some limits. And we give something new, technological advance, as well as new design with fancy outlook. Uh-huh. I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales. Okay. In the market. I'm not sure. Yeah. But for 25 years, it raised 12 euros, 50 manufacturing costs. I think that might. I can't say. Although, I mean, three. Three. Sure. They have got, I mean, they are going crazy with the LCD technology. So that you've got your LCD TV to everything. So maybe the small one. I mean, like, I have the black and white, I guess it just doesn't look funky enough. But, I mean, like, even mobile phones or whatever, I have color LCD screens. Yeah. I mean, I would know about the cost of them. Uh-huh. But I'm sorry. I'm notwithstanding, um, isn't too complicated. Is it going to be too much just overload? Uh-huh. Yeah, that's a thing. It's going to be easy because there will be on LCD screen. There will be different, different icons. They can just click, okay, whatever they want. When you use remote control, you never look at it. Right? Yeah. You're looking at TV. Yeah. That's true. And it just seems kind of like a service. And one of the survey findings was that they wanted easy to use. So I think I'm not sure about the LCD. It's a great, it's a good idea. But for a budget and for the thing we're trying to go for, easy to use, it's not the thing we should go for, I think. Child friend, I thought this was good. As you pointed out there, um, the bit often goes missing, especially with children. But it's a good shape and the organic is kind of, we could make a vegetable-y kind of round shape, I think. So which version? Yeah, I know carrot. So since we're great for the, uh, the company colors, I think your lemon wasn't that... Yeah. And if it doesn't work, you know, it's just a bit of lemon. Yeah. Um, the child friend, yeah, easy to use. It seems quite easy to use. I like the different shapes of the buttons and stuff. I think that's a good idea to go. I like the colorful buttons as well. Yeah. And the mouse one, I thought it was a good idea because people use my, my mouse is now with this scrolling thing. I mean, we are marking the sort of 35 to 35 so most people will have come in contact with us. Yeah. So they'd be able to use that. As I said, I think I'd presume it would come up on the screen. Yeah. So there you go. That means you get to bump that into the TV, it goes. Yeah. So that's the user interface. It's the same. Okay, take this out now then. Okay. So I guess there are a lot of options that we're going to have to choose from among. Yeah. And I'll give you the technical considerations for those. I don't use a whiteboard just because we haven't used it. Yeah. I was just thinking of the self. So the one thing to do this is we're going to take a look at some old and no controls. See how they work. We use the final kind of essential pieces of it. And then we'll throw in our new innovations and keep it all in budget. So, I'm looking inside a very simple and not control. This is what they sent me. Okay, here's the competition I suppose. You open it up, there's a circuit board inside. And there's a chip password, the TA-1835, which receives input from the buttons. This is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip, because it's very cheap and like this is my cost nothing. So that takes the signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it sends to the amplifier, which is made of some transistors and amplifiers, up amps. And then that gets sent to the LED light, which I can see is a red light bulb. And that sends out the infrared light signal to the television. So this is kind of the bare essentials that we need to have in our remote control. So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum amount? No, I mean this is very old ones, so now the new technology is going to be a minimum of small and keep almost a key thing. So this is what we need to have for certain. So as I said, we got the outer casing, the tripped side, you know, it's going to be the board we have to use this, the same setup, processor, we'll probably use a more advanced processor than I had, amplifier and transmitter, or all standard. So for the casing, this email I got from our manufacturing team, you know, we have a bunch of options from wood, titanium, rubber, plastic, but not latex, dull curve. So lots of choices, what do you think? Well, the sponge, I guess, is it on there? I don't know, latex has a kind of spongy feel to it, doesn't it? Yeah, it's very last-a-cheap for sure. Yeah. And that would also give it kind of durability. And it's also relatively cheap to cast. So I'm going to base a sort of plastic, initial plastic with a latex kind of sheath. Okay, so here are a plastic latex. I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think, you know, that could be a bit of a gimmick, like it's good to hold. So something would give to it? Yeah. Okay. And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around. The car is yellow, right? Yeah. Or at least incorporate it. Yellow incorporated, yeah. Okay. I mean, I forgot to... I don't know, other... I think... I think standard silver, kind of, other parts, or... Yeah, the buttons, like, because there's going to be the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons, and probably two different colors. Or if we're having buttons, actually. So yellow, and body, and then what color for the buttons? I quite like the multi-colored buttons, you say? Yeah. You do have ones like playing, could be green or on and off, is red, and stuff like that, yeah? Yeah, or yeah, maybe it's a little bit... It makes it easy to use. Oh, a color so it doesn't look too childish. Yeah, that's true, because that blue one did look quite childish. Although I mean, this also comes to shape as well. I mean, if we are going to make it a novel... I mean, double-curve sounds good to me if we're talking about it, so ergonomic and easy use. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so the shape we want to go... How exactly, maybe... Like an hourglass kind of figure, is that what you're thinking of? Or just like... Yeah, that's sort of comfortable to hold, easy to hold, so you don't drop it. It's not... What about a banana? We could make novelty remote controls. Well, yeah, I mean, like... If we could have a big banana shape remote control, because yellow... Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And a lemon might be a little bit... But then how would you point it? Yeah. How would you point it? It doesn't matter which end point. You could have a little LEDs in the chat. There we go. Yeah, I appreciate this idea, because then this... This will help us in our advertisement also, and we can relate it with fruits and vegetables. The people's choices, that whatever data shows that... Yeah. What do you... I'm sure Red Banana idea. So, it's Fungi. Rubber Banana. I mean... Okay. It does seem like a... Again, childish, maybe. Yeah. I think maybe just draw on the kind of... Fruit and vegetables shape. What else did you say about fashion until it was... Ah, the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables... Like, people... No. And spongy. And then a file... Fruit and vegetable. So it has a stem, perhaps. Maybe. Yeah. It would be some... Like, what's... What's that? I don't even know the name of it. It looks like a little snowman kind of thing. I don't know the name of that. So it looks like this kind of... Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Like a gourd? Yeah, maybe that's a bit... It's black. Because that you can hold it in like bottom bit. And it has a clear top and bottom. Yeah. So you know, it transmits from the sand. Yeah, I don't know why the hell not. I don't know. What do you think? I don't know. What do you think? Well, I guess it's kind of... You don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit. Just have that kind of fruitish shape. Yeah. Yeah. Then only we get a little... Yeah, something... Yeah, exactly. So double curved, single curved... Yeah. Or we can do something we can design two, three shapes and we can have a public survey. Let the public choose what they want. That's a good, learned, that's a good idea. Okay. Okay. I guess, since you're the marketing guy. Yeah, sure. I will be happy to do that. Okay. You can do that. What are the lessons, did we say, different shapes or buttons? I mean, for the specific functions, you know, up and down, placed up. Okay. They've got, I mean, they've got standard sort of intuitive things that are always used. And... It's like that. Yeah. That's cool. I like it. But the scroll wheel or no? Yeah, what about the scroll wheel? Speed track ignition. Speed track ignition, I think. So we need a microphone, presumably. I could put the microphone here. It has a microphone. Yeah. Where should I put it? I mean, are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use? Yeah, I'm not sure. I mean, those ideas I saw were just for inspiration, I think. I do not know. Yeah, I can... Okay, I'm worried. I could... Do some user tests with scroll wheel. Yeah. Yeah. And I think if this new software for the same recognition is that you keep it in the microphone. So should the microphone be just anywhere on it? I would put it sort of sub-centrally, so it's... Yeah. So it can be sort of held in. We're really, really going to need to hold it if it's going to be a voice recognition. Not what we can... Oops. Oops. Oops. So let's not use the whiteboard anymore. Yeah. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. I'm sorry. And so what else was there? The... What about the glow in the dark thing, the strip around it? Are we just going to need that? I... I still like it. I really like it. But that's me. Because we've got the technological innovation with the speech recognition. Yeah, some of it is just going about too far. I mean, we are pushing it probably... Because it's... It's going to... Yeah. And don't want to... Especially with yellow. I don't know. Because I mean, like... I mean, how good is this speech recognition thing? Do we want to go for buttons at all? Do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit? Do you put it in the fruit bowl? Yeah. You know, and then you just start from... I mean, like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the tail. It could even encourage healthier habits for television watching. Yeah. Make them think of fruit. Yeah. Just make sure they don't eat their amount. I mean... Yeah, do we? I mean, I... Like, think of a fruit that could sit. So then the pen will lay on its own, like, uh... I know, an apple. It's just apples. So... Yeah, the apple's there. I quite like the design of that, because that could sit on its own. And... Yeah. It's quite... It's got a steady bass. Ruby? And as we say, we don't want to be too ridiculous with the fruit things. Yeah, about the speech thing, it doesn't have to be handheld, of course, it can set a distance. Yeah. So, I mean, like, you could actually... Yeah, it's a good choice. Or we can do one thing. We can just have a remote control, and causing some different different shapes, different fruit shapes. In such a way that any causing can be... Could be fit into this mobile general piece. So whatever people want, like, if somebody wants it in a banana shape, we will put that casing onto that mobile phone. It's so light. It will look... Yeah. Yeah. You said about disposable things. Sorry? You said about disposable, Ellie. People want disposable things. Like, if this is a mobile phone, we will design causing in such a way like, half of... We need not to have a full cover. Yeah. We will just have a half of cover, okay? Like, if somebody wants it in banana shape, we will fit banana shape casing onto that. So it will give a banana shape look. If somebody wants it in apple shape, we will design that. We will put apple shape casing on that. It will give apple shape look. So in that way, you can have any... Means whatever you want. Okay. Without... Yeah. You need the buttons in the same place. Yeah, button will be on the upper side. Yes, there's no need. Buttons will be on the upper side. That's the other side. Buttons will be on the upper side. Lower side, we will just put the casing. So half of that will be... No, half of free. Yeah, not the upper side. So from lower, you can... Means while you are holding... From this side, you can have banana look or apple look, whatever. Okay. Okay. We need not to have different, different shape, mobiles, everything. We will just design k-thing through shape. Okay. I think that if you're going to have a fascia, then you want to have it so that it does go for the buttons. Because I mean, if you think about it, if they're wanting it because they want to look at it, if they're using it, and what they want to look at is facing away from them, it doesn't really... Because that'll be in the palm of the hand, we'll be able to see. Yeah. Unless you have serve. You've got the buttons option on one side, you get the fascia on the other side with the microphone, so that you can place it face down. And you've got the fascia, and you can just talk at them. Mm-hmm. Maybe. Okay. Um, so... So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options. Yeah, so... I guess we decide on material, right? It's spongy, latex rubber, everything. And the color is... Yeah. The shape, maybe we'll just make it kind of mix and hatch, type of shape, or... Well, because... Well, I'm not sure if we should go so far on the whole fruit thing, because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit. Okay, we're stuck with what we've got there. Yeah, well, I think we're trying to get to 25, 35-year-olds, want it quite trendy as well, they said, they wanted something that looks fancy, and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a... too much of a gimmick, but something ergonomically shaped and organic, like, good to hold, based on fruits and natural things like that. Okay. Because already we're going a bit... Gordy with the yellow, you know? Mm-hmm. I mean, we could make it a nice pale yellow. Well, it's kind of got a VR company, so... Okay. So, again, I mean, like, we could have... I mean, we could quite easily have the main body be a different... Yeah, maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow, with you said, the Logan, the slogan... And then going round, yeah. Because... I mean, even if... Not necessarily that the whole body has to be of the company colour, so, you know, blue and yellow tend to go to well together, so you have the main body blue with the yellow, local and slogan running up one side of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Sure. Okay. Um, as for the energy source, you know, almost every... You know, probably it's just batteries, but we don't have to be limited by that. We can use a hand dynamo. Um, that's great. I think it's basically the more you move it, the scully thing inside that just kind of powers it. Yeah. Or is it a dynamo? Yeah, a dynamo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like with those watches that you come to us, yeah. So it's quite normal. You see people's natural reaction anyways. Yeah. But, do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo? These type of cells, because then people have to... Like, if this head is out, it's a bit... Yeah. Especially if they want to use it specifically as voice activated. Yeah. Because most of the people... And then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then... Yeah. Okay. That's true. Right. What are the other options? Solar power. Solar power will also not be a good idea, because then they have to keep their mobile's outside. Solar energy and the days when there is no solar sunlight. I'm with Raj on that. I think... Yeah. I've got not facing hands. I think we should rechargeable. Battery will be a good idea. They can recharge it. I mean, I have a bad idea. I have a bad idea. I have a bad idea that I thought just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of... And we're very invariant, different company. Having a rechargeable stand. Yeah. So that not only... Yeah. There was a stand but for using it as... Recharging it, but also for using it. Yeah. So in recognition. Like one of those portable phones. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So a rechargeable battery. Yeah. Okay. The user faced the buttons. I guess we talked about this, right? We were watching chip on print. Sorry. Never mind. Yeah. The electronics. Basically the more features we add. The answer chips we need to buy and put in which adds to the cost. I think we can keep it all on the budget. So the speech thing you said our technology, our research and development department came up with some breakthrough. So, yeah. We're just having buttons on the speech then. We're getting our cheapest option of... Chipping. Right. That's good. Oh, okay. We're kind of... Keep the end of the screen out. We're kind of... I've just deleted that whole thing. We're kind of running out of time. So if you could... And... Was that you? That means you're a bit discovered. Oh, yeah. Just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to see next. Excuse me? Yeah. So... Oh yeah, I'm sure I think. Yeah, mine seems to turn off. I can't do anything. I just touched the pad. You just touched the pad. No. No. You actually showed that. It's on, but there's nothing to do with it. Okay. Now... What... We have... Our next meeting is in half an hour. And what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in Cle. Oh, I guess they do it too. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So, you know, I mean, luckily we chose a nice simple shape. And further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches. Okay. That's great. Save everything to the shared documents. Oh, yeah. I hope I can recover this because of that. So we deleted it. Which doesn't really help you much. I think I'd save mine already. Yeah, can you save that? I send that last one again. Please, Raj. I still can't find it on there. It was under a different name. I will show you. And she heard documents. Okay. Working components. Oh, you didn't get that. No. I will send it. Okay. I will put it in shared documents again. Yeah, project documents. Project documents. Sorry, I put it in the shared documents. All right. That's actually... It goes there automatically if you put in project documents. Project documents is on the desktop. Right. But I can't open that because it... I'll serve for some user name on password. Okay. Yeah. Let me show you. It's a tile mix. All right. I think... Hold on. So... Yeah, I don't know if you... It just came up on my... on my agenda. I'm... I'm... Presumably this clay somewhere. Um... Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah. That's good. Whoops. Light. Light, please. Light. Right, there you go. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Quite. And we're using this sort of basic chipset. So... It's all good. Oh, sorry. Are we done with anything? Um, I think we're almost done. Yeah. You have to give your fans a separate one. I used your pen. Oh, oops. Sorry. Okay. Still didn't manage to get that over. So we have the chargeable and... Uh... Ah, pause. Okay. So we came up with that. Okay. So we came up with that. That's okay. It was supplements. It was supplements. Uh... See? Cool. Fine. I should have gone. See, I knew that. I should have... So... Engineered it so we ended up making it. Yeah. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Engineered it so we ended up making it a different, different difficulty. It's for cruelty. Yeah. Star-free. No, no, no. So we literally make it sort of... ...butchers and everything. No. Should we do it? We have to do buttons. Right. Um, will you go ahead and do this for something? No, I think that's a discussion over and less than. Anybody's got questions? Confusions? No. Excuse me. Um, we'll probably get a question in a minute. It's, uh... Sorry. Thank you. Yeah. I'm going to go warning finish meeting now. I'm running to the upper parking. Uh, did it, did it, did it. I'm going to the upper parking fast. And did it, did it, did it. I'm going to go in. My document says it one more. My private document. There we go. There we go.",
        "abstract": "The Marketing Expert presented the results of a market survey that indicated users' most important preferences in remote control features. He discussed trends in fashion that should be incorporated into the prototype design. The User Interface Designer compared the designs of several competitors' remotes to decide which features should be used in their own design. She discussed using voice recognition, an LCD screen, and color to make the device easier to use and to improve its look. The Industrial Designer went over all of the internal components and materials that will be incorporated in the design. He gave a layout of the placement of the components in the device. The group decided to use a rubber or latex material to give the device a spongy feel. He discussed the color and shape of the remote with the group and the placement of the components on the device. The group discussed colors and shapes further, and decided that the remote will be yellow, and perhaps having a fruit-inspired shape. The group decided to use a rechargeable battery and recharging stand. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype.",
        "actions": "The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will build a prototype out of clay for the next meeting.",
        "decisions": "The remote will feature a rubber or latex casing. Several shapes will be designed and shown to the public so that the most popular shape is chosen. The remote will be yellow or partially yellow and have an organic shape. The remote will feature speech recognition. The remote will be powered by rechargeable batteries and come with a recharging stand.",
        "problems": "The group had difficulty deciding how to incorporate the company's yellow color and the fruit and vegetable trend into the prototype design without the remote seeming overly gimmicky or childish."

Hold on. Let's play the game. I think this way can't fall off. I think that's... Well, go on, follow me. I'll do that. Okay. I'm gonna stick it. Okay, I'll use the powerpoint. How was that? Was that fun? Yeah. Very fun. Okay. Oh, I forgot to mail you the minutes, but I will do. Oops, Daisy. We... All right. Okay. Someone gets a pen. All right. Do-do-do-do. Do you guys, first of all, you prototype? I probably get to make good news. Yeah, there's goodness. You have budget problems. In the fridge for a second. Oops. I thought you'd have this on. Okay. Okay. Have you got a presentation to make? No, I'm not making it. Maybe I should bring them. Okay. Sure. Okay. We made three for you. One space on the banana, one space on the tomato, and the other one. Oh, yeah. Well, yeah. We had some red left over. Okay. So this is the non-buttons. One or as few buttons as possible. Mainly, speak recognition. The yellow there is the slogan that we need to incorporate. It's very simple. If you do need buttons, you can flip it over and there's some there. Okay. But mainly is speak track ignition. Okay, so the buttons would be like individual users. Yeah. Yeah. Or, yeah, they might project things onto the screen, which you can do on there. Oh, yeah. I'm not sure about that. And this one is the one more like the one that we looked at earlier. Right. Yeah, you guys can. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. Well, like the few of it. Yeah, sure. That one is... Oh, no, it's delicate. That's already got it stand, that one. That's it stand. It does also lie flat. But that's the yellow stand there represents the charging stand. Okay. The black on the back is the slogan. Okay, nice and obvious. Yeah, that one... Well, we did think of that. Yeah, if it's standing up, it's on there. But also we're going to have the company name on the front, which is the little black kind of line in the middle. All right, okay, brilliant. So, and that's the transmissivity, LED thing. These are the two scroll ones, which you thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down. We weren't sure about putting them there because it's kind of could get bad. Yeah, where you're holding it kind of. Yeah, well, if you hold it, you can hold it. It does actually feel quite ergonomic if you've got small hands. Obviously, I don't think that's real sized thing. It would have to be a bit bigger. That's a speaker at the top, so you can speak into it like a little walkie talkie as well. So, you can also speak for recognition. And then the buttons, kind of self-explanatory, just buttons, whatever you need them, try to keep it simple. Oh, that's the charging base prongs at the bottom. We used those tools to try to that. And then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one. It's not in the traditional place, but it's quite obvious. Excellent. So, there we go. And we have the banana based on two. I suppose for the younger audiences. Okay. A more friendly. So, Barney the banana. Right, right. Induced more television watching. Excellent. Just what you need. Yeah. So, it's a Loch Ness banana. Right. Cool. Well, yeah. Nice to have options at least. Yeah. So, are there any improvements or issues or...? Oh, there are issues. Oh, there are issues. And as well as I down the one step. The main problem that we have, unfortunately, being finance. And I says entering the evaluation criteria. Unfortunately, the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons. It's going to cost us 14.6 euros. So, we have to re- Sorry, I accidentally highlighted some. There we go. Oh, God, why is it not that? There we go. So, basically, in order to save our two euros, I was thinking that we could have a sense of the same sheep, but just have it flattened. More like a traditional remote control. Yeah, I mean, it's already got a kind of cool sheep. So, but it wouldn't have to be curved in and out. And by doing so, I don't know, it doesn't save us quite as much. I don't know what's going on with this again. What was the double curve two of them? Oh, good point. And... Double curve on both sides. Yeah, this is double curve. This one is single curve. This is single curve. This is curve on both sides. No, I think it means double curve doesn't... Like an S-shade. Like a single curve on that bottom here. And the double curve would be if it was that similar curve on it. Okay, I might be wrong with that. One this side? One got a one that's... I don't think that counts as a curve, but that's just a sheep. The curvature is like the case. Okay. That's the biggest expense. Yeah, I know why I've got it too. I can't seem to slack anymore, however. Well, we can work around that. Right. What is that? What do you think it should be one? It's meant to be one. Yeah, I don't know why I've got two in there. But I'll don't tell if I find out if it is a chef bot. Maybe stuck again. Yeah. It is a chef bot mistake. Okay, so that's... So it's take away three, which would give us... Oh, that's fine. 11 euros, 60. Cool. So we can even add something. We could... I don't quite have the scroll wheel, unfortunately. What? Fire the accountants. Hey! Yeah, look at that. Thanks. Hey, if you click back in that bottom right saw, where you're starting from, and you see arrow keys, is that what? Yeah, not just extends as well. You can do one thing, right? You just select one box outside. Yeah, this works. Then move it with the help of this. Okay. One of the boxes is taken. Just a minute. Okay. Now move it like this. No, it's not as a chef bot. Should we ask Melisa? Should we ask about technical? It's for it, Melisa. That's fine. We've worked out what it would be anyway. Did you try both chef buttons? Yeah. Okay, so... Oh, that's today. Oh, no, wait. Right, so that's finances. I don't know what we... What could we do? We could add? Well, maybe we could add something, but maybe if... What is that, sir? That's our design that we've got. Yeah. So... If we're happy with designers, they're quite spending money if we don't have to. Yeah. But if there is anything you think we've messed out there, then you know, feel free to add it. Maybe... I mean, obviously it would be bigger, so there might be more space for the slogan on the front. Because it's not in an ideal place right now. Well, that's... Okay, so project layers. We have under 12. That year is 50. Project process, everything that went... We're happy. Oh. Yeah, I think we have a winning product. Okay. Tch-tch. No, you're eating. I don't know if you're eating this up. I think you're eating quite smoothly. Room for creativity, will we have to with that? I think we're very creative. No, I think it means sort of individually. Oh, right, okay. Yes, no, maybe. Okay, gravy. So we're just going to... Yeah, okay. Teamwork leadership, sorry. Great leadership. You're all getting a raise. Teamwork, I thought, well... Yeah. I don't know if anyone got enough input, I think. And, well, means, yeah. Yeah, we use... That's five more. Right. I don't know what new ideas find means, to be honest. Yeah, these are new ideas like glow in the dark or something like that. We discussed all the new ideas, but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals. We couldn't use these latest ones, but we are using these scroll buttons like this. These are new ideas, new shapes, everything. Yeah. Atleast gravy. Yeah. So just general thumbs up for all of us then. That kind of, unfortunately, is too quick. Okay. Well... I don't know. I suppose, yeah. So let's talk about our bonuses and raises. Forget it. So I think another couple of days, holiday pay maybe. Well in order for all of you. Let's see if we can get this. What do you think? Whoops. Maybe we should start cleaning up the play. Yeah. So... Does it go back in? Does it? Reusable. I see it's maybe something like that. Something... I don't know what's the next. So it's really free and light. Uh. Right? Have you finished? I have. Yeah. My needs also there. Atleast, my needs also there. Presentation. All right. Oh, you go for a test, sorry. It didn't bother to tell me that. Well, that's... Thing. Is it? Okay. Uh. It doesn't tell me. Is the projective eluter that is my name? Oh, you're doing it. We're gonna value it ourselves. We thought we were great. Yeah. Love to be that now. Kind of a green banana now. Wait, I'll rip it down. It's... This is well sorry. We've got to mention we've made out of kind of a rubbery latex new material that we've got. Oh, hey, I'll run. Danny Blut. I've got to. Yes. Oh, hey, I'll run. Danny Blut. I've got to. This one's touch. Yeah. that will, what do you want to touch OK, yep I'm feeling she had that bit So now is the final evaluation, final evaluation of our product, how we are going to means at what standard, what standard, whether it means our standards or not, how we are trading we will give to these products. So of course this will be a teamwork, we together have to decide what trading we will give to this product and everything. But methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this. We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements, whether it means the user requirements or not, this product then trends, whether it is as per the latest fashion trends or not, means because we have already studied that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays. So this is also an important factor, five-valuation also, then marketing strategy of the company. As we have already discussed that our company is quite raptured in the market, not only in terms of providing quality products, not only in providing latest technologies, but also in terms of providing environmental, but also in terms of providing environmental safe products, like keeping in mind all these safety issues. So now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale. I am having this scale, this scale. So we have to do it on a board. Okay. Okay. You should be as a user. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Good. So. Okay. Thank you. Good. So. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So these are the three criteria criteria for evaluation of our product. First of all comes user requirement. So we will see whether this product made so all user requirements are not. I will first I would like to have your views. What do you think? Whether you made so user requirements or not? I think yeah, it did. It had all the basic buttons that they needed, as well as the new technology that people said they wanted. So what rating you will personally. I would say seven. Seven. Seven. Seven is good, isn't it? I think three or false. No, sorry. One. One is true. One is means highest ranking. Yeah. Okay. But I think highest ranking is seven or one. No, it's like true is one. Okay. Okay. Right. So it's one from your point of view. And what do you say of a industrial expert? It's hard to know. You can tell on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design because she was a very interface expert. But you can give your views based on technology whether the technology means the requirements of the customers or not. Yeah, I think it might even exceed it. But I guess there's kind of a shortage of buttons. See, I'm going to give it a two. Two. And what about you, Brian? I'll go for one. You will go for one. Basic requirements. Okay. For me personally, it is everything fine. It may be having good design. It may be meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology wise, price wise. But there's one thing which limits the customers like we are having only two, three designs. Like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange. And yeah, like. Yeah, orange. And the third one is what you get that is not of a fruit look. But if a person doesn't like banana or orange, you are limiting him. No, don't buy our product because we are we like this only. Okay. So we are showing our preference for particular fruits two or three kinds. And. Freters. Yeah. Is that not trans? No. So personally as a marketing expert, I don't believe that because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits, they give a range of products range of shapes. Like if we see look at the smallest thing, tofist chocolates, they give a variety of different things. Some children like to buy banana shapes, some apple shapes, some even pineapple shape, some orange shape. So you can't know means what shape a person will like. So in this case, giving only one or two choices, we are limiting our customers. And by limiting them, we are limiting our sales, limiting our profit also. But in electronics, I think it's not always quite so. You don't always have so many choices is with chocolates. I think, you know, if you're going to buy a TV, maybe a company will have. That you're going to choose from a company will have two or three choices, but they're different designs will come up with one product. Maybe okay, but I will, I will personally won't give it training beyond three. Okay. So we can, yeah, on average, we can think three, four, seven, maybe three or four. No, sorry, it should be. What are we doing? No, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, we are doing very wrong things. Yeah, yeah, we are taking every and that's I have taken it very wrongly. Yeah, three, four, four, two, six, seven, seven. Yeah, one by exactly. So we can say one or two. Okay. And because it is one point eight, just reaching two, so we will do two. Okay, yeah. So, how about the trends? Can you explain what you want us to write there? Sorry. How, how conforms to the current trends? Yeah, again, the the fresh and trends, this also like, whether it will be fashionable to have these products in the, is it a, is it a fruit shape or something? Okay. Well, going on the specifications that we had that fruit and vegetables are quite popular and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons. I would give it, well, because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at, that it looks cool, you know. Why would actually give it a three, three or four, not sure, three or four? Okay, okay. Okay. As far as the technology, it's got the latest trends in speech technology, but it's missing the screen, as you said. But does have push buttons or the scroll buttons, but doesn't have that fancy solar power, the vibrating energy mechanisms. I give it a, a four. I give it kind of middle of the road for technology. Yeah, I'm sort of pretty, just the fruit does me in. Maybe trained it to some, but I'm just not swollen the fruit. So, also, I would like to see now see the screen in it. So, yeah, I'd say about four or so. Okay. Personally, I think that in terms of trends, these products are quite good, like these products are in fruit shape, because that people now, our fashion trend shows that people like everything, everything is being advertised like clothes, shoes and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables, or getting them some as in or showing some association with them. So, and in this way, our product is good. And the second thing now people don't want any complicated or bulky project and our system is quite simple and quite handy. So, that is also that also our product meets the fashion trends of the market. And yes, it is spongy also. So, they can play with it. It's quite good. So, then I think maybe I can give it to. So, for four or ten, thirteen, thirteen, so we can, is it fine? So, what about company strategy? Um, the company strategy. Okay. There was a lot of disgusting. It was good. I feel like I got my say. So, I give the company strategy two. I think it's the remote control conforms to the company strategy. Is that the question? Yeah. Is it okay? Okay, so one or two? What? Okay, just get it to. It's fine. I got it too. So, what about you, Brian? Um, yeah, I pretty much kept the company strategy, so I would go for a... One, as we know, we kept it, but we were limited by it. Yeah. And me also, like this product... This meet-soul company strategy like, our product should be as per customer's requirement, as per latest technology. And it should be environmental safe. So, since our product meets all these requirements, so I would also prefer to give it rank 1. So, 4, 6, 6. Yeah. So, we can say 2 or 1? 2. Okay. So, 7, 7, 8. Overall, we are getting two pensies, something, but we can round it as 2. Okay. So, I think overall, evaluation of our product is quite good, so we can launch it. Yeah. In which case, we are done, because we have evaluated and we are within budget. Okay, so... Jumping lunch. Yeah. I like... Okay. What made me was that, since I have to write up a couple more forms. Yeah, yeah. I've got a report to write, so... I like my job. Yeah, with the claim. Yeah, can you... I love gender free. Mine is there in... There's a certain project. Yeah, that's good. Okay. Okay. Okay, there are things. Okay. I don't know what I call the subject, the subject, or... I can't tell.",
        "abstract": "The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototypes to the group. Two prototypes featured different fruit shapes, with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons. It also featured scroll wheels for channel control. The other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind. The Project Manager announced to the group that with all of their desired features, the project would go over the alotted budget; after a reanalysis of the features of the prototype, the project came in under the budget instead. It was decided that another feature could possibly be added. The group evaluated their effectiveness as a team and felt that all members worked well together and could be creative, and that the project had very good leadership. The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product.",

There will also be a child-friendly banana-shaped remote. Both the company name and slogan will appear on the remote. The remotes will be bundled with a yellow charging stand. The devices were made with a latex product with a rubbery texture. It was decided that the product had met enough of the initial project goals to be launched on the market.",
        "problems": "The Project Manager felt that the group had been too constrained by the budget. Some felt that the banana shape would not appeal to enough of the market and that there was not enough variety in shape in the remotes to make up for this problem."

        "transcript": " Okay, so this is our first meeting of this design project and I am glad to show you the agenda for the meeting. I don't know if it was sent round to all of you. I don't know, anyway. This is the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly, although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already. Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more. Then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the course of the design project and the meetings, specifically the whiteboard over there. Then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan and discuss, come up with some preliminary ideas about it and then that's it. So we've got 25 minutes to do that until 11.25. So any questions? No, at this point. So this is our project. What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television. We want it to be something original, something trendy and also something user-friendly. So it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product. The method that we're going to use to complete the project that has three components as such. There's the functional design of the remote control. The way we'll do that I think is to work individually, initially and then come together for meetings to work on that. Similarly with the conceptual design, we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together. Then the detailed design will come after that. We'll pull it all together. I'm a bit confused about what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design. Is it just more detail? I think we're talking that the functional design is more your area of things where you'll be, we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what specific things it has to do, but the conceptual design is perhaps bigger than that and includes how people can use it and that kind of thing. Where do we identify the components of our product? I think it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify. It's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product. I think we'll start that initially with the functional design already. That's just a brief overview of the project itself. What I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for the project. Specifically, the whiteboard. Each person in turn, I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard, the pens just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what your favourite characteristics of that animal are. While you're doing that, tell us your name, what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project. Would you like to go first? I do have a choice. Oh, thanks for all the help. You don't have to hurry, we've got plenty of time. My name's Katz and I'm really not quite good at this whole drawing, but I like it. So, I always ruin it. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. I always ruin it. Okay, cool. She's a rabbit. At first I thought it was going to be Katz. I didn't think it's fair enough. I can see by that ears. It's a fluffy rabbit. It's fluffy. One day you'll be able to genetically modify them and they will come in pink. What's your role within the team? I'm the marketing expert. I'm going to be doing the appartling according to the little guy on the computer that knows everything. The user requirements specification, the functional design, trend-wotting in the conceptual design, and products of valuation in the detailed design. More about yourself. I'm from Leicester. What else do you want to know? I like sport. A very big kickboxing spinning. But not with rabbits. Not with rabbits. No, no. And bats. I like bats as well. And I like cocktails, especially people. My name is Marika. There's the pen. If you haven't got enough room, there's only a razor there. You can wrap it up. I'll make it smaller. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. It looks like a dog. I think it needs four legs if it's going to work. Maybe it has some coffee patches. I do like dogs because they are good friends. Two people and they are loyal. I like to compare to some other animals. They are really much more fun because they are not so independent. Maybe the fact that they protect their home as well. What it has to do with my role in the project is hard to say. I hope to be loyal to the project. I'm from Estonia. Yes. Is there anything else you would like to know? In the different stages of the design, I will be responsible for designing the technical functions of the remote control. In the conceptual design stage, I need to come up with an interface concept. In the last stage, I will be responsible for the interface design. Thank you. I will wrap the features. I will wrap the drawings. My name is Gaurav. My favourite animal is a cow. I have no idea how to draw a cow. This is going to be... Let me draw the body first. They would have long tails. They are like you. There is some grass there. This is what I like about. I don't disturb anybody. They are kind of put this in a way. I like cows. My role in the project is the industrial designer. I am supposed to design all the details of the product, how it works and whatever it will take. During the functional role, what are the various functions that have to be performed by it? During the conceptual design, what are the various components of it? Finally, I am not to show what was the last part. The detailed design, I guess, will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other. I am from India. I am doing my PhD in cycle linguistics. I sit at the department of psychology. Thanks. Now it is my turn. I will not be sweating. I am very cute. I like dogs too. I can't do that already because I can't do a dog as well as you can. Is that a lizard? No way. Wow. It's a gecko. Oh, a gecko. Okay. Is there a difference? Are they also like lizards or are they yet? Yes, they are kind of lizard. And I like geckos because they remind me of warm places. And where I was living in Cambodia, they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little geckos. I hope you don't like snakes. I don't like snakes. I go to Australia and we have nasty snakes. I am from Melbourne. And I am your project manager for today. And my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way. So that by the end of the day we come up with a great product. Wonderful. Okay. Thank you. So let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation. I thought about this that we could even put it much more proficiently. There we go. Okay. So this is the overall budget for our project. We have planning to sell these remote controls for, let's make that go away. That means we have got five minutes. We are planning to sell the remote controls for 25 euros each. And with that we are aiming for a profit of 50 million euros. And that's selling them on the international market, not just in the UK. So to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum 12 and a half euros so that we can reach that profit target. So that's something to keep in mind when we're designing. Okay. Let me just skip ahead to say that's the last thing. Okay. We've only got a couple of minutes. Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about what we're thinking of this? Yeah, I'm just wondering whether there is like any special feature that we want to have. Want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones. I think that's probably something that it's best if we take away with this. But if we all have a think when we go away from the meeting what specific things could be included in this remote control. I think in the beginning one thing was that was mentioned was that should be trendy user friendly and original. So I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this. Yeah, I was looking at the website and the other things that they've made and I like put down some inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures. So the motto is we put the fashion in electronics and so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional. So I'm kind of thinking like those phones that they have the new generation ones where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that. All right. I think I'm getting towards that so it's not overly. I mean, I don't know what most of them do on my own account. So I think I have medium age, you know. So perhaps I'm sort of menu based thing on something that's a little less crowded than this. Like, I mean, theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your TV. Yeah. But what do most people do? They turn it on. They watch certain specified channels. Yeah. And then they turn it off again. There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used 90% of the time. But will be used 10% of time. There's no need to have buttons on it to do that. Maybe to do it could be one button for a menu or something that's used. Yeah. And then use that. So if you're a kind of sad case that knows how your Macintol works, then you know, that's fine. And you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have these buttons which is confusing. Excellent. Because like if you look at the train, it's just very like there's no extra bits on it, the train on the website. I don't know if I haven't had that before. But it is just like a long, like thing used to moving people, but it looks really pretty too. Great. Any other immediate thoughts? We can aim for, I mean we can think about all these little things, but we can aim for something that gives a high battery life. Although I don't think that it's a huge problem for a more controlled, and even battery life every now and then you need to replace the batteries. Yeah. But I mean, even though it has to be original, we shouldn't go like too far away from the usual ones because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with learning. Yeah. So it should kind of fit in as well. Like it's fancy with a teeter type of a. But you can't access because you have no idea how to get in, but the design is not very great. Okay, so we need to wrap it up now so that we can go and get on with some of this. We've got another meeting in 30 minutes. So you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace. So basically you're looking at the working design. You're looking at the technical functions design. And for you it's the user requirements specification, like I said at the start. Okay. Okay, thanks for that. Thank you. I'll see you in half an hour. See you. Carry the laptops back again. Do we need to unplug things? Probably.",

After they talk about their overall budget, they discuss what special features they want to include in this remote control that existing ones do not have. They discuss making a menu-based remote which would be less crowded with buttons and therefore stylish and sleek but functional. They end the meeting with the project manager going over the task each member is to complete before the next meeting.",

        "transcript": " Okay, so now we're here at the functional design meeting. Hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time because this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually. The agenda for the meeting, I put it in the shared documents folder, I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not. No, no, no. I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well, so if you check in there, there's a shared project documents folder. And it should be in there. I'm under what, or project documents, yeah. Yeah, okay, yeah. So I'll put it in the area. Is it best if I send you an email maybe to let you know it's there? Yes, yes, thanks. I'll do that next time. I'll act as secretary for this meeting in just take minutes as we go through and then I'll send them to you after the meeting. The main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time, so we'll go through each of you one by one. Then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us. Yeah, the last minute, yeah, the last minute I'm sorry about that, but we can see how that affects what you are doing. And then we need to, by the end of the meeting, come to some kind of decision on who our target group is going to be and what the functions of the MacControl, that's the main goal is to come up with those two things, target group and functions of the MacControl. And we've got 40 minutes to do that in. So I would say target groups, what does that mean? So who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing? Okay. So we need to, yeah, we need to have a fairly defined group that we want to focus on and then look at the functions of the MacControl itself. So with that, I think it's best if I hand over to you. Does anyone have a preference for going first? I can go first. Okay, so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours. Close your streams to give nothing else into the Commons. pp Right. So from the... Just before you start to make it easier, would you three mind emailing me your presentations once we... You don't have to go back. Okay, once you go back. Just so that I don't have to scribble everything down. So with regard to the working design of this remote control, I've identified a few basic components of the remote. And from the design, functional design perspective, we can now know what exactly the components are and how they work together with each other. So this is the method that I'll mostly be following in my... In my row, the identification of the components. And since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects, I would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person. We'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level. And basically update and come up with a new design. So it's a cyclical process. Okay. So these were the basic findings from today. The last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email. I just quickly jotted them down. So basically, as I told you, the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it. And what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other. Okay. So the email said that teletext is now outdated. So we need to do away with that functionality of remote control. Also, the remote control should be used only for television because incorporating other features makes it more complex. And the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television. However, our remote control will only be dealing with the use for television in order to keep things simple. Also, the management wants that our design should be unique. So it should incorporate color and the slogan that our company has it as it's standard. Okay. So here is a functional overview of the remote control. There's basically an energy source at the heart, which feeds into the chip and the user interface. The user interface communicates with the chip. So I'll basically go over to the... Okay. So if this is our energy source, this is a cell. It communicates, it feeds energy into the chip, which basically finds out how to do everything. There is a user interface here. So when the user presses a button, it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal, which then... So the output of the chip is an infrared bitcode, which is then communicated to the remote site, which has an infrared receiver. There can be a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating. So all the functionality of the remote control, whatever new functions that we need to do, make the chip more complicated and bigger. Basically. Okay. So in my personal preferences, I'm hoping that we can keep the design as simple and clear as possible. This would help us to upgrade our technology at a future point of time. And also, if we can incorporate the latest features in our chip design, so that our remote control does not become outdated soon and is compatible with most televisions. That's about it. So anything that you would like to know or... Do you have any idea about costs at this point? No, I don't have any idea about what each component costs. Is that something you need to consider, I guess, if we're using more advanced technology at might? Certainly. So we definitely need to operate within our constraints. But unfortunately, I do not have any data, so I just identified the functional components. Are there any more questions? Or should we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together? I think we need like some general discussion of the end. Yeah, I think that will do. Okay, so do you want to... Yeah, I think since we were discussing some design issues, then I would like to continue to support the whole list. I think that has to come out of here. Thanks. Yeah, I thought those last minute things are going to hit use at worst. Okay, we hope, right? Should it just... Yeah, it'll take some time. It takes a little more. There's just nothing else. And have you... You need to then also press... Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right. And... Erm, F8. So the blue function key at the bottom. Okay. And F8. Okay, something? Yes, coming out. It'll come up with... No signal. No signal. Why? Maybe again. Yeah, yeah, it says something now. Oh, just... My computer won't blank now. Okay. Interesting. I just see. But I don't see anything on my computer now. This is the problem. If you press... If you press function and that again, there's usually three modes. One where it's only here. One where it's only there. One where it's only there. One where it's... Okay, so one more time. Okay, so one more time. And now it's... Okay. No? No. You should... Yeah, just wait for a moment. I just do... Okay. Okay, that's fine. That's good. Okay, let's start from the beginning. So I'm going to speak about technical functions design. Just like some... Some first issues that came up. Okay. So the method... I was adopting at this point. It's not... For the whole... Period of the... Of the project. But it's just at this very moment. And my method was to look at other remote controls. So mostly just by searching on the web. And to see what functionality they used. And then after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web. And just to think about what the user really needs and what the user might desire as additional functionalities. And then just to put the main function or the remote control in words. So the findings were that the main function of the remote control is just sending messages to the television set. So this is quite straightforward. And some of the main functions would be switching guns, switching golf. And the user would like to switch the channel. For example, just changing to the next channel to flip through all of the possible channels. Or then the other possibility would be that she might just want to choose one particular channel. So we would need the numbers. And also the volume is very important. So you could go back. Okay. So switching on off channel. Okay. That's great. Okay. Among the findings, I found that most of the presently available remote controls also include other functionalities in their design like operating a VCR. But they don't seem to be able to deal with DVD players. But then there are surely there are many other functional functions that could possibly be added to them. But according to the last minute update, actually, we do not want to have all these complicated functions added to our design. So my personal preference is would be to keep the whole remote control small, just like the physical size. And then it must be easy to use. So it must follow some conventions. Like where about you find the on off button and maybe the color tends to be red or something. Then yeah, the must have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then the one that allows us to go to the next of the previous channel. And then volume has to be there. But then other functionalities could be just there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen. Then for example, brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu. And yeah, the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate more functionalities. And the answer was already no because of the last minute update. So for the time being, that's all if you have questions. If that was the directive that came through from management, but if we had a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video on DVD, I could get back to them and see. It's just whether it's worth arguing about. Yeah, and also it's another question is because there are so many different things that could possibly be included. Because besides video and DVD, there are the video CDs and whatever. So yeah, it might be problematic to choose between all these possible things. Okay. Are there any questions for clarification of Marika before we go on to the next one? So in the user interface requirements, we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want. So at this stage, how we go about implementing those buttons, we will not identify or we can completely do away with buttons and have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that. But is there any thoughts on that? Well, I think the buttons are still kind of the most easy for the user to use. What other options would you have a little screen or something, but this would be really kind of a lot of learning for the user. And I mean, the user just wants to get a result quickly, not spend time in giving several orders. I would think the buttons, but if you have other proposals. I think the costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them. We can probably wait until we have more knowledge on that. If the costs allow, we can have an LCD display. Because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well. Sure, we can discuss that maybe after the next one. Do you want to give me a little cable thing? Yeah. Alright, am I going in the right direction? No, wait here. Okay, here I'm getting hungry. Okay, here you are. That's why it wouldn't reach. Okay, cool. Is that? Okay, functional requirements. Yes, we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on our... Hello. I try to pronounce it wrongly. It's working? Yeah. Excellent. What I have, where I've got my automation problem, is a survey. The usability lab I'm served for my control use with 100 subjects. Then they give them a question now. It's all about how people feel about the looking field of the remote control. We'll see most annoying things about remote controls. The possibility of speech recognition in our CD screens in remote control. They actually gave me any answers on the LCD screen so I should have taken that back. Anyway, okay, so what they found is that people don't like how common remote controls are. So, you know, definitely you should be looking at something quite different. 75% of users find remote controls ugly. The other 25% have no fashion sense. 80% of users would spend more to get a nice looking remote control. Current remote controls, they don't match the use of behaviour well as you'll see on the next slide. I don't know what zapping is, but switching between channels, sort of random way going through. Oh, right. But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on. Okay, 50% of users say they only use 10% of the buttons so that's going back to what you know. We were saying earlier about do you need all the buttons on the remote control? It is make it ugly. Okay, cool. So this is one little bit difficult to see. If you explain it to us, it'll be fine. Okay, well I can send it to all of you. Yeah. What it is is it's cones because I thought it'd be more exciting. I like that. Cool. I'm going to start playing with the little punting. Okay, so what it shows is how much things are used relatively. What you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection. What you can't see is volume selection is a little bit higher than all the others. That's the next one along, yeah? So what the graph shows is the power channel selection and volume selection are important. And the rest of them nobody really uses. So the numbers are a lot on the top but present their importance. So on a scale of 1 to 10 how important is that? And you know, channel selection volume selection are absolutely essential and the power while it's not quite so essential apparently. Although I do understand how it can be. And everything else I think you can forget about having those buttons on the American talk. So just not needed and then I used. Okay, this is the bit that the email messed up for me. That's what I was fiddling about with the beginning. Okay, cool. So this is what people find annoying about American roles. They get lost, they're not intuitive and they're bad for repetitive straight injury. I think if you're watching enough TV to get repetitive straight injury from watching TV, that's the least of your problem. It's up there. So I mean the RSI thing would be that like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your rest up, there would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic design that encourages good use of the remote control and not straining your rest watching TV. Yes. Okay, cool. Right, sorry, this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table. I didn't have time to write it out again. Okay, but that shows how people, whether they would pay more for voice recognition software. So you can see from that, you know, younger people, see age of 35 are quite likely to pay quite a lot more, well quite, are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software. Whereas as people get older, they're a bit more skeptical about it and they're less willing to try it. So clearly voice recognition is something to think about. But you know, I do wonder how well that would work given that a TV, you know, tends to be people talking and you know how you're going to stop it from just flipping channels or swatching TV. Okay. Cool. Okay, so these are my personal preferences. So you have sleek, stylish, sophisticated, you know, so something that's, you know, a bit cool, you know, functional. So it's useful, but minimalist. There's an important thing that, you know, people use when, you know, when you're filling up your home, you know, a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap, basically, you know, and you've got this stuff and you're just like, what the hell is that? Who is ever going to use it? You know, so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both. So I think we need to aim for both. Okay, then long back to life, like you were talking about earlier. And you know, I was thinking solar power would be quite cool because, you know, your remote control just sits there and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit. And then like a locator, so, you know, kind of like you have a mobile phone or not a mobile phone. Some kind of a ring. Yeah, that's it, you know, whistle and it's where my flatmate and I were talking about this on the way and he knew this morning and I was like, I need to get one for everything. So yeah, so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps and then it kind of sound that you don't often hear on the TV. You know, because you don't want to remote control beeping every five minutes. Because you then deliberately lose it by throwing out the windows and things and say, okay, cool. That's me. That's you. Excellent. Very good. Very good. I'm just going to take this. So we've got about 10, 15 minutes to discuss. I think one of the very interesting things that came up in Cape Cat Cat's presentation was this issue of like voice recognition being more popular with younger people. So if you need to have a target group, then I think as far as the motto of our company is concerned if you want to have things leak and good looking, we are better off targeting a younger audience than you know, people who are comparatively elderly. Yeah, I mean, that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey, you know, whether, you know, these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish microphone, but I'm assuming you know, yes. But the survey did say that things like voice recognition are more popular with them. So if you want to put in something stylish then it will certainly be more popular with the younger people as compared to older people. Yeah. Then again, I guess the where it was most popular was the 15 to 25 bracket. Right. And I don't know how often they are buying television. Well, that's when you go to uni, isn't it? But you don't have much money generally. I would assure a television or something. It's more that 25 to 35 when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys. Yeah. But still, if you can go back to that slide and how popular are they? I'm sorry, I'm not getting it. That's already if you can just look it up on your computer. Yeah. People between 25 to 35, how popular are ones? 76. Still quite popular amongst them. Even they are 76% of the higher. Yeah, and I mean I know what you're saying about the 15 to 25 yards but I mean it has been proven that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like, I mean, you know, if you invest in them, you're paying your rent but you don't have a mortgage, you don't have a life insurance policy. Usually not like hard and normally have a car. You still need to buy that. I've actually said that, it's just cost more than a car. Yeah. Say, I mean, like it is an age group to target really. And if we're talking 25 euros is a price that's not unaffordable even for you. No, I mean that's like 15 pounds. Yeah. Yeah, this is not unaffordable but the problem is whether people need it, whether they do have a TV. Yeah. I don't know many people without a TV. We didn't have a TV last year and everyone thought we were for heads. But the TVs are often kind of someone's old TV. Yeah. And the remote control might not be remote. It might not even function with a TV. Yeah. Well, we've... But even in the case of 25 to 35, it's quite popular, right? Yeah. Or maybe we can just kind of... I think the fact that 91.2% of 15 to 25 years old is saying, yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition. Yeah. When I control this, I say quite a lot really. So, I mean, that and the display is like bullying, and I don't think it's something to ignore. And the same time, I think, maybe we can just decide to have both of these groups as our target. Because, actually, I mean, they are all still good. It's not much different. Yeah. If we take 15 to 35, but that does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition. Is that going to have an implication? I was having a general outlook on most sophisticated features. But voice recognition itself, I'm not very sure about it because one of the things that Kurt pointed out was, how do we go about implementing it? You do have it in your mobile phone, they don't need it because you have, I mean, every mobile phone now has, like, call this person. And it calls it. Well, how frequently do we use it anyway? Yeah. How good is it, you know, voice recognition software that's still quite... But with a TV remote, it's going to be quite limited if we're saying the main things people want to do is on off Channel 5. Yeah. Right. So, that should be relatively simple. You would maybe need a code word. Do you know what I mean? Right. So, like, when you say, change, it's been said quite a lot on TV, so maybe, like, you know, remote. I mean, how often do people say remote on TV? Although I only watch Chan, so really, I'm friendly. But, like, say, just say, remote 5, you know, remote 10, remote 19. Okay. So, it seems like a feasible thing to implement. Yeah, but maybe if you want to look into that just to check. So, if we go for the 15 to 35-age group... Yeah, but then, of course, we're going to get anyone who's older than 35 who wants to look young and hip and trendy and have money. Then, now, they'll still go for the same advertising. I think there's a lot of voice recognition. Well, now, the voice recognition, if it works wonderfully, we could possibly do well with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet, because people are just so used to buttons. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of... I think we need safer. So, we need both. So, the voice recognition would be just an extra. It wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote. What I was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on TV and how they are numbered on the remote control. If we can do away with that, our product can be really popular in the sense that a person can say, I want to watch ITV1 instead of saying that I want to go on channel number 45. Yeah. So, if something like that can be in cloud 3. So, that is that was in the voice recognition. Yeah, but then the code word would be even more important, because I mean sky advertising every channel to me. So, then it would be watching charm. And then the sky adverb, come on, and it would change to sky. Sky. Yeah. Yeah. And that would be really annoying. Right. But that's it. Yeah, but on the other hand, the remote control is close to you. You probably might just speak into it. And the TV would be already farther away, so it might not pick up the things coming from there. You know, I think that defeats the objects of having voice recognition on the remote control. So, that you can yell at it. Yeah, you know, so you have to have the remote control. It's more like if you lost it and it's down the surface and you can yell at it. Or just change it, you can look for it later. Yeah. All right. Yeah, but then the remote control, I think, I mean, the idea is kind of, it's not that it's sitting there on top of the television, because then you could already yell at the television, and you wouldn't need the remote control. So, the remote control is still something you keep near yourself. Yeah. I suppose, never too. Yeah, I think it's like if you have some sound. And it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise. Yeah. So, the remote control being close to us, not to yell at it from the distance. Another thing that can be used is that there can be a beeper button on the TV, so you can go and press that button and the remote control wherever it is. It will beep. But then if you're buying the remote separately, but you could have something. But if it was something that you could like stick onto the TV or something. Right. Yeah. If you bought it in a two-part pack, so one part attached to the TV. Yeah. And then you didn't lose it. They're being located. Well, that's right. But it solves the problem of having different noises. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Okay. I think we're going to have to wrap this up. But if we go away with that kind of general specification in mind that we're looking at 15 to 35-year-olds, we want it to look simple, but still have the button. And then we want it to look simple, but it's easy to use. But only those key buttons. The major buttons. Yeah. And then one sort of menu one. And then voice recognition included as an option. Right. But that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible. And some of those problems we were mentioning. What we have to do now is to go back to our little places, complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation, which you'll get immediately by email. Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes. And then we've got a lunch break. And after lunch, we go back to our own little stations and have 30 minutes more work. I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder, but I'll send you an email when I do it. So you know, should be on your desktop. So on the... Okay. Yeah. So I'll put them there as soon as I've written that. Did you find it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And email them round. I'll see. You want our PowerPoint presentations in there, he? Yeah, that would be great. So we'll just put them there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But is everyone's called functional requirements? No. No, they're all called something slightly different, technical requirements, something that's good. So if you put them in there, we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to. Okay. As to where we're going from here, you're going to look at the components concept. Right. Yeah. Whatever that means. Yeah. Yeah. You'll be looking at the user interface. Conceptual. Yeah. Something conceptual. And you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition or the math or something that will keep our... I was supposed to look into components. Components. Sorry, but the next meeting, are we going to have it right after lunch or shall we prepare? We have after lunch, we have 30 minutes to prepare. Yeah, that's fine. But before lunch, we just have to complete the questionnaire in some sort of summary. Okay. Okay. For right on time. Okay. So you can, I guess, we'll see you for lunch. Okay. See you.",
        "abstract": "The project manager opens the meeting by stating that they will address functional design and then going over the agenda. The industrial designer gives his presentation, explaining how remote controls function and giving personal preference to a clear, simple design that upgrades the technology as well as incorporates the latest features in chip design. The interface specialist gives her presentation next, addressing the main purpose of a remote control. She pinpoints the main functions of on/off, channel-switching, numbers for choosing particular channels, and volume; and also suggests adding a menu button to change settings such as brightness on the screen. She gives preference to a remote that is small, easy to use, and follows some conventions. The group briefly discusses the possibility of using an LCD screen if cost allows it, since it is fancy and fashionable. The marketing expert presents, giving statistical information from a survey of 100 subjects. She prefers a remote that is sleek, stylish, sophisticated, cool, beautiful, functional, solar-powered, has long battery life, and has a locator. They discuss the target group, deciding it should be 15-35 year olds. After they talk about features they might include, the project manager closes the meeting by allocating tasks.",

        "transcript": " Excellent. So I sent you the agenda that was on the project document. I don't know if you've got a chance to just have a look at it. Anyway, the meeting is going to follow more or less the same structure as last time. So we'll go around each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to. And at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts. So that's we need to know about the components, properties, materials, the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching. Okay. Do you understand? Okay. It's got 40 minutes. So I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation. Yeah, I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead. Okay. So basically I'll start off by I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options. And what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are more highlighted underlining them or something like that. Okay. So I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anywhere. A brief introduction to the insights of a mode control and then we can probably discuss the various components. Yeah. Okay. So what you see here is this is the outside of the remote. Right. If you open it, you have a circuit board here. Right. And this is the chip that I was talking about last time. This basically sends information to a transistor here, which then sends the information to an LED device here. If you flip the printed circuit board and this is the most important point here, everything else is kind of. So if you flip the circuit board, this is what it looks like. So you see, for example, a particular button attaches to a particular place on the PCB. Yeah. And on pressing this button, I circuit completes the information goes to the chip, which is somewhere here. And the chip that then translates the code into an infrared radiation, which goes out through there. So the important point that I read over the website was that the configurations of these printed circuit circuits are quite. You can get them printed as you want to. So we can have a configuration irrespective of the cost, the way we want to have it. Right. So that's the important point here. So these are the different options that we have. Okay. So the batteries, I'll start with the battery. Right. So they can be simple, which is like the normal batteries in our results. Yeah. These are the kind of kind of batteries that the company makes. So hand dynamos. Is that like a wind up one? Yeah. I don't know if even if you want to consider this, but these are the different things that the company makes. So they'll, since they'll come internally from the company, they'll be cheaper all these options. So the third one is the kinetic energy one. You can make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike and then you could exercise walls, watching TV and charging the element. Yeah. And still worrying about the whole RSI. That's a good option. So what was the kinetic energy one is that usually in modern watches, since our hand keeps moving, it keeps the watch ticking. But I don't know if it is a good idea for a remote control because it will just lie there for a long while sometimes. As soon as you pick it up, it moves and then again it recharges or something. And the fourth option is the solar cells, which are also environment friendly. Okay. So I'll enlist things and then we can come back and discuss what we think from a very pretty perspective. There are different cases that can be provided. They can be basically the shape of the cases. They can be flat. They can be curved with one sided curved and one side flat. And they can be curved with on both the sides. These are the three options. I mean this would be like they were all shape of the remote control. They can be flat on both the sides. It would be curved from one side. There were different kind of supplements available. Like it can be plastic, rubber, wood or titanium. Okay. Did you say wood? Wood? Wood. Yeah, you understand why we get to purpose. Okay. So we can use even so titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment. So it's kind of it'll be probably nicer to use because it relates to the overall image of the company. It cannot be used on a double curved surface. If we choose this, we cannot use titanium for these two. We can use titanium, wood, rubber or plastic. Okay. The interface options now. So we can have push buttons like most remote to and our company is an expert in making push buttons. We can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointer. Yeah, something like that. And they can even have an integrated push button inside the scrolling. The scroll plus push. This is something that has been recently developed by the company in the last decade. So not two recent. And LCDs. We can have all CDs. These two are recent. And this is quite old. The various electronic options are. So this concerns first of all the chips. I showed you that. So there's a chip behind this one, right? The PCB is inexpensive. So we can put in whatever we want. But the various integrated circuit options are. We have either a simple one. Or a regular. Or advanced. And the price goes up. So we go down. Okay. So the good thing about why we would want to use advanced. Why we might want to use advanced is that LCDs can only come with the advanced chip. We need regular or advanced for scroll wheels. And the chip basically includes the infrared center. Besides this in the electronics. Also the company has started making a sample center which did not explain what it was. But I'm guessing that. So they have a sample center and a sample speaker. So I'm guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like. You know, as soon as you press a button, it. It gives you feedback. One five or whatever. Yeah, on. And I don't know whether a simple center has to do something with voice recognition or not. But anyway, so these are the different options that we have. Okay. So that's that's basically now. I think that we can integrate. You know, the user interface and the marketing things in that. Keep taking out things from this and underlying things that are important. Excellent. Do you want to stay somewhere near the board so that if we need to? Yeah. You can sit down. But we might need to lay back. I have some PowerPoint. Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. These pens can give you cancer of the hand. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah, it should do it. Interface concept. Okay. To be honest, actually, I mentioned some some of the things which could fit under under this talk. This time, I mentioned them already in the previous talk. So, yeah, this time, I might not have them on the slides, but I can just mention them again. Okay. So I thought I would also include the definition of using interface. So it's the aspects of a computer system or program which can be seen by the user. And which the mechanism that the user uses to control his operation and input data. So this would include things like shape and size and buttons and voice recognition as well and color and so on. The method I employed this time was again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet. And then analyze them from the point of view of user friendliness and also whether their appearance was pleasant. And then this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product. So some findings. So in the case of many user interfaces, they are just so full of buttons that it's actually hard to find the ones you really want to use. And it's just confusing. It takes time to learn. Okay. So I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found. Okay. Some of them are here. Well, the picture is not very clear, but as you can see there are actually. Oh, sorry for that. Let's go back. Oh, please. So yeah, they are quite big and have many, many buttons. Actually, all these I personally prefer this one because it's the smallest and with, with least, with the smallest number of buttons as well. And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice. Okay. So let's carry on with this. So other findings. Some new things used. Some of them were mentioned already by our technical designer. Our own company has developed a new user interface. Wait, no, this is not the one. There is a, we can include voice recognition and it allows, it's possible to record 80 different voice samples on it. So this one was already mentioned, the LCD display. Another new development is a scroll button, which was also already mentioned. And our own manufacturing division has designed a new programmable speech, sorry, a speaker unit I guess it should be. And this means that it comes together with a voice recognition. But it's, once the gadget recognizes the voice of the speaker, there can be pre-programmed answer. For example, you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says hello and your name or whatever. I mean, this is also one of the new developments, we might consider if we wanted to. Can you go back for a second. Are you sure what this means, the spinning wheel with the LCD display? It's like the, like you said, no, the scroll button is a different thing. I have a picture, if you, just a moment, I'll show you. So I wasn't completely sure myself, but I think it's just like, it's a wheel. It's like not separate buttons. Look, this one here, but I'm not really sure whether you can really turn it around. It's like a press list or this. Maybe I part is like, you know how you have your mouse and you go around and it's kind of like that. And it's been around. So instead of going down, you just spin. You just go around and there's a bit weird at first, but it's actually very like fast. Like the wheels that click on the side, you get a much slower. So it's quite good if you're like searching quite a lot of stuff. I know if you're looking, you're going through the A to Z of your music and you're looking for something at T. Then it's a lot faster than the wheel, but you've got a lot less control over. Right, so I should include that here as well. Plus spinning. Yeah. Okay, and the personal preference is pretty much the same as last time. It has to be small, simple. Okay, we decided to include voice recognition. So the standards of the major buttons like gone off, the channels and then volume. And then there has to be menu on the screen. And I also saw if we want to fit small and nice. And actually I quite like the idea of a scrolling button for voice. Like on the movements or something. I think there is no reason why we can use something like this for the remote control. So yeah, that's it. Okay, straight to trends and then we can discuss it all at once. I can't hear you. I can't hear you. I can't hear you. If you two could both do that. Two. Two. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Cool. We'll search the inserts, come up with market trends. And what users are going to be wanting in the near future. Okay. Right? No, the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect. Which is twice as important as the third aspect. So I mean the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the, given the target group is what you would expect. You know, people want something new, something technologically innovative and different. So the whole idea with the LCDs and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like, quite the thing to go for. And yeah, it wants to look frankly. So maybe as you're discussing things, is it okay if we just keep highlighting things here? So, so we're on the internet. So it's probably voice recognition is kind of important. Maybe the LCD and spin-in. Yeah. I have point about LCD. LCDs are basically for feedback to the user who is pressing buttons. And the feedback can come through the television itself. Do we need an LCD on the remote? I've asked you television runs really good. You've got one of those tele-west boxes. And you port the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to TV and then you wait and then it comes. So it actually takes quite a long time. But if you get the number wrong and it's a bit of a pain. So I think a screen on the remote would probably get down any time and that. But like the roads do tend to get thrown out of it. It is also quite nice though to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen. That's true. It would be like if you could make it integrate with the TV then it could come up with your information about what's on. And you could just see that on the remote rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure. But I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to have your mobile phone. You know, like you have the slide you want and you have the flip you want. And then the screen is protected so it doesn't actually get scratched. So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control. Or like a minimalist remote control. You've got your buttons one to nine, you're on and off. And you're volume on that. And then if you want to mess about it, you flip it open. And yeah. So we seem to have a consensus that LCDs are definitely the way to go because of style. Yeah, so that kind of decides your whole chip thing. Right. You agree? Yeah. Yeah. Right. So. OK. LCDs. Definitely. OK, apparently, the food and vegetables will be providing inspiration. So I just give it a heart. So these will be an important feature for clothes, shoes and furniture. So I mean, I'm taking this to mean, you know, carvenous. Do you know, because you don't tend to get flat vegetables. Yeah, possibly even, I mean, even. Yeah, a bit of asymmetry and stuff. But that would be a good way to get in the whole RSI issue in there. Because I mean, if you think most people use the mokkatole with their right hand, right hand, so you want to you carve it so that it's suitable for you to do it. Right hand. Yeah. I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy. Something a bit squishy. Yeah. Yeah, we have it. It could be like a rubbery. Yeah, rubber. But this is just with using. I suppose you would get a right hand. And it would help if you drop it. It protects it as well. Yeah. Yeah. So if we use latex cases, they won't allow us to use solar cells as an emergency. So we could use titanium, wood or plastic. Or if we want to use the latex, then we have to go with one of the other. Yeah, we're sure. We're sure. We'll get the kinetic energy fairly easily. From the different depth. Yeah. We could have a little board. Yeah. So probably double curved surfaces is the way to go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or curved at one end and flat on the top. Because I'm not sure if it is flat on both sides. Then how much easy would it be to reach for buttons etc. Yeah, tell us and I'll let the flatness out. Yeah. It depends on the whole. So I think it's like how you put your hammer so you can release it in the middle. Single side curve or double side curve does not say too much does it. No, I don't think it makes a lot of difference. I have one of those slightly fiends and I mean the back is essentially straight, but it's curvy. So besides the other four sides to a thing. I think so. So I mean, one side means one side is straight. Right. And curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curve. Did it say anywhere in your research material about this lighting stuff? Because I call it the intuition that I have, I think, the only options that we have with the cases are the EC3. Yeah. Either you have a flat surface to the case or a curved surface case. It does not say anything about whether technically this stuff is available at all. But this is more about the protection of the LCD which I think is what I carry on. My research didn't tell me anything which is why we have all the pictures. That I have to do with my time. Okay. Cool. We got. Combined style with a level of functionality, beauty and price quality. And the thing is, function. Okay. Yes. So looking at what we've got. We want an LCD display with a spinning wheel. Let's try to rub off things. Yeah, rub off some of those. So hand animals are definitely out. You are aware of that. That's not streamlined and sexy having a wind up. Kanata Kanata just seemed to have some kind of a appeal. But. It's about the practicality of a really easy technique. As against a watch which constantly keeps moving, this thing will have to be tapped every time which might be very frustrating for the user. Depends how much. How much. Movement really needs. I don't know if they're suggesting it. Then what could you do? Okay, let's keep it off. The flat completely flat case is definitely out. We know. It has to be at least uproar from one side. Okay, we still have all the options. Would you think would? I can't. How do you? I mean, you can't keep it really small. You can't make it like thin and. Right. The wood thing because you need to put all the technology in. So I mean, if the case, you add the case. Yeah, if it is a bit bulky. If it is really thin, it's likely to break. It's much more. Yeah, given that we're looking at more spongy material preferences. Would think maybe rather all plastic is more. Wood's not very clean, I believe. That's true. It's not practical. I mean, it's right for a table but for a muconfoil, you know. And splinters and stuff. Yeah. Okay. What is that? It doesn't make any sense. Yeah, in the case of remote control, remote really. Yeah. Okay. Now for the really interesting stuff, the interface. Yeah. Right. So the push buttons is our expertise in the industry. But it seems to be out of trend. You know, nobody's. Yeah, but have some push buttons. I think for the channel numbers, you still need them. Would you? Yeah. Yeah. Right. If we have LCD displays that opens up a whole world, you know, if you have an LCD display, then you can stack almost everything on the LCD display. Yeah, but I think the LCD displays kind of, yeah, it's faster. And if we just, when we discuss that we might like this flipping open thing, then I mean, you can use it as a normal remote control. Yeah. But if you do want to use LCD, then you'll flip it open, but it's more time consuming. I think this is going back to the graph at the beginning. I made where, you know, the buttons, the people use all the time, you want buttons to them. Yeah. And everything else. Yeah. Many don't. So in the buttons we have, for the channels also, we have options. Do we enumerate everything from 0 to 9? Or do we have just a channel plus channel minus just one? No, no, no. I mean, we definitely need the numbers because it's otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels. Yeah. Do we need them as buttons? Or do we need them as LCD? On the LCD we can, you know, say buttons because it's, yeah. It is. So, I think the thing is, so if someone just wants to turn on the TV and put on a channel, then it should be easier to use. Yeah. Then any of them are made. And then if someone wants to, you know, change the contrast on the TV and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible. But, you know, I mean, most of the time, I mean, there's a limit to how much the biggest technique is. There's the biggest technique and it's been fiddling with the TV. I think it's the base, you know. Okay. So, buttons definitely, but shall we try to draw our... I think that's what you guys are going to do next. Now, okay. So, if we put down the key... Okay. So, components. Yeah, we want... What about the scrolling? Yeah, but I'm not completely clear. Yeah, about the spinning wheel. So, I think it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing. You cannot include everything in the spinning wheel. Just spinning and not scrolling. Yeah, I would say that the spinning goes at a higher speed to the scrolling wheel. So, you have to decide whether you, you know, you want to be going so fast or not. But, I mean, the thing with this hole, if you're planning on making out of rubber, on the basis that it's spungy, I'm not sure how well I scrolling wheel would work. But if you've got a flip thing, effectively, it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side, but you fold the wheel in half. Yeah, the spinning wheel tends to go to one side. That would be on one side. I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber. Yeah, I think so too. I mean, the case would be rubbed on the buttons. Or at the corner, as you just, the edges covered by rubber or something like that. Everything else in plastic or even titanium if you want to use it. Or maybe like interchangeable cases. Because I know, like, we're going back to iPods again, the whole spinning wheel. But I have like a, obviously, my iPods not made of rubber. Then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it. And I can change the colour, theoretically, to match my outfit. Right. Okay, so that gives us a more trendy look as well. Yeah, I think the spinning wheel is definitely very narrow. Right. Yeah, and we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway. That's right. Yeah, that's right. So rub that out. And colours can be provided with the case rather than... But we still need to think about the colour offer mode as such. Yeah, I think it was a requirement that we use. For the colours of our company, so would it be like yellow, grey and black or something? I guess. That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme. Bananas? Bananas? Yellow? Yeah, definitely. I mean, do you think we're giving corporate the colours of the company into the buttons? And then make the colours the main remote. The colour like vegetable colours, you know? So you could have like, I mean, I suppose vegetable colours would be orange, green, and some reds. And maybe purple and then you'd paint the buttons in company colours to that. Yeah. Okay. Okay. If you go over to the integrated circuits, since we are having LCDs, there's no way that we will be able to. What we do need to consider, however, is that the price is going up with every such thing that we are considering. But since LCDs seems to be a definite yes. So it seems to be one idea where we would want to spend. So I'll rub off the other two. So we discounting solar energy because rubbers going to be used in there somewhere. That was the constraint was... We can't have solar panels with rubber. So yeah, okay, so we lose that, I think. Should we go for... if we're going for rubber, we think of it as our case. And then... And the buttons as well, isn't it? Yeah. I think... Like, 5 more minutes. We'll have... Using simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one. I mean, although it does seem interesting, but it does not hold any advantages as well. Yeah, it's just a gimmick. Okay. Okay, so we understand this better now that the speaker is for the feedback, right? It says the things that you type in or something like that. I think if we can include them at not too much extra cost, then I'd put them in. We don't have too much information about it. Yeah, but I think it should be quite cheap because it's from the company. Okay, so this is in as well then. Yeah. So I'll push the curve. Okay. And the case is curved on one side, but then flat on the top. So it's flipped into each other. Okay. Can I pull the... Yeah, sure. Thank you, sir. Just so I can... Sorry, I just... Nothing gets right. What is ICIC? ICICs? Integrated circuits? So it's advanced integrated circuits? Yeah. Welcome to that. We're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as on CDs. Yeah. Okay. So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery, the advanced chip. And a curved on one side case, which is folded in on itself. Made out of rubber. And buttons are also rubber. We're having push buttons on the outside. And then on the inside and LCD with spinning wheel, we're incorporating voice recognition. That's how it will look. And it's going to look sort of vegetal. And be in bright, vegetable colours. So would we have the spinning wheel inside, with the LCD or would it be on the altar? Imagine it would be inside. Okay. Actually that kid really cut down your thing. So you've got your outside, which is minimalist. And then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel, which you can incorporate buttons in to. So you still not got a lot of stuff in there. You've maybe got... Like if you're modelling on iPod, you've got five buttons and a wheel. And four buttons are in the wheel. And the other one is a little bit inside the wheel. Yeah. Sure. Okay. So now we've got 30 minutes before our next meeting. In the meantime, the industrial designer over here is going to work on the look and feel design, which I presume will work out what happens. The user interface designer will work on the user interface design. And the marketing expert is going to work on productive evaluation. And as well as that, the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay. And you will get extra instructions from your personal coach. Is that all okay? And anyone who hasn't put their presentation in the project document folder, it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it. Cool. I'm going to go and sell my aim. Oh, nobody wants to talk to me. I know. I'm plugging myself. I'm hating. I've got a bit tangled up in this. So shall I move away first or shall I say here? I don't know. Maybe two. I would care.",
        "abstract": "The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. The industrial designer begins presenting, first describing the insides of a remote control. He lists the options for types of batteries, shapes for the remote case, materials to use, and functions to include such as push buttons, scroll wheels, and LCD screens. He then talks about the type of chip certain features would require. The interface specialist begins presenting, first defining user interface and then showing some examples of remotes. She mentions that many existing remotes do not have a nice appearance, and states her preference for a remote that is small and simple and contains a scrolling wheel. The marketing expert gives her presentation about user requirements and current trends. She shares that fruits and vegetables are popular, meaning curviness and assymetry are in. The group decides to use LCD screens to give the remote style. They discuss what material should be used, talk about how the surface of the case should look, and plan out the general user interface. After they make some decisions about the remote, the project manager closes the meeting by telling them what their tasks will be until the next meeting.",

        "transcript": " This is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting. Again, I'll take minutes. What we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from the presentation. So, diligently. There's a record that in Katz going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this again. Then I need to say since a few things about finance because we have to check that it's within the process of production and design. We've got 40 minutes. And then we get to make a link in Katz. Because we missed out. So, it's now, I guess that was supposed to start with the 35. So, we've got until 4. So, we've got 40 minutes. And then we get to make a link in Katz. Because we missed out. So, it's now, I guess that was supposed to start with the 35. So, we've got until 4. How much do we have? 40 minutes. Yeah, about 40 minutes. I'll tell you about 40 minutes. So, yeah. Okay. So, is it, are we starting with the, yeah. So, will you maybe start with the shape and things. And then I will explain the, they use interface, things like the buttons and the screw. Okay. So, basically going without trend of vegetables and we selected the color and approximate shape of banana. I think the banana is the same thing to use with the panic. So, it's just an approximation. Do you use perfect? You were making color. Does it vibrate when you press the button? Sorry. So, basically it's the flip open thing again. So, we have the, okay. The maricover will explain you the user interface there. And it flips open on the side. So, it opens like that. And we have the user interface in here and the LCD and the school inside. Well, everything else is probably user interface. And it's the whole thing made of rubber. Oh, yeah. It is. Yeah. Do you make every smaller one? It could be made a bit smaller and of course it will be shiny. Yeah, but one thing we actually kind of forgot while designing it. One side was supposed to be rounder. So, is it the backside? Well, since it's made of rubber anywhere, I think it's... Yeah. It does look like the front's like curvy and then the whole shape's curvy. So, I would say that it's curvy. It looks quite like a vegetable. Yeah. And it's spongy as well. So, I keep them. So, they're using the face as we discussed last time on the cover. We just have the very basic things. We have that channel here starting from 1, 2, 3. There would be numbers on the actual one. So, it's 4, up to 4, up to 7, up to 9 and 0. 0 here. Yeah. And then, well, this is on off button. It's quite standard place for it. And also the colour is quite often read. So, it's kind of user friendly. And then, these ones would be for flipping the canals back in like the previous one and the next one. And we would also have a little thing saying here, previous and the preven. Where's the volume? The volume is scrolling on the side. You can't see it. This one. You can get that. And it's on the back cover or back lead. Because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here. Okay, can I see. So, the volume is you just scrolled. But then once you flip it open, there you have the screen. And you have the spinning wheel with options to choose. You can move back and forth. And then, if you need to choose something on the screen, you just push the middle button. Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button. A mute button. We will have this on the screen on the display. So, on the cover, we have the barest and the wheel. On the wheel if you flip it. On the wheel down, then it will. On the LCD, you know, the main one, you will have a bit of a... But the scrolling is kind of, you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right? But if you're all the way to the scrolling, isn't it? That's a scrolling click. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And so, the whole mutation. Yeah. And okay, so the voice recognition is also just part of it. You can't really see it in the interface. Yeah, it's hidden in there. And we do have the logo. Very good. So, I think, and it's with the black and yellow in the right hand. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah, I think we could do the logo in gray as it is on the website. Yeah. So, you can have a look. Yeah. I can't. I can't. I can't. So, it's an intermediate color like it. Yeah. Oh. I'm holding it. It is the golden slamming. I hate play days with minions. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. They're in clip. Okay. So, maybe if we go on to evaluation criteria, again, we'll... I suspect we're going to have a couple of minor finance issues. But we'll see. I'm sure we can get around them somehow. We'll just send all of them and the factory into some nice poor country. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the only process. Yeah. Wow. Wow. For example. Cool. Okay. Right. Okay. Okay. Okay, cool. So what we're going to do is prepare the evaluation of the new design. So we're going to be using the 7.0 scale. So one is, you know, yes, it totally meets what that requirement and 7 is, no, it really doesn't. We need to go back and start again. You know, basically what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and made a list of them, you know, so that we can evaluate each one and like, so it's about going back to the start and saying, oh yeah, we did manage to do that or I don't know, we really forgot about that. Cool. So these are what they are. So we're going to put each of these we need to give it a 1 to 7. Yes, I did have a B C and D down here, but it seems to attend to like just a lot of us. Never mind. Okay, but if you can imagine that they say A B C and D, that would be really good. I guess we'll give it a good maximum point in everything. Yeah, yeah, it's definitely attractive. Yeah, I agree. I was a locatable thing, we actually forgot. Well, I thought you'd kind of said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the TV. Yeah. So I just prepared to prepare one now. Yeah, I've got to be rich. Cool. Okay. So be attractive to look at. That's this one. What do you all say? Seven was the maximum. Yeah. Yeah. I go for seven. Yeah. We're all so proud of the calendar. Okay, so be attractive to look at. That's this one. What do you all say? Seven was the maximum. Yeah. Yeah. I go for seven. Yeah. We're also proud of the calendar. Okay, so that will be a seven. I'll know you can't wash that stuff there. Okay. I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in. Excellent. Excellent. We can't. Yeah. I can take notes. I'll take a note. Okay, so we're all agreeing on seven. Cool. Okay. Does it match the off-wating behavior of a user? I think it does. Yeah. The only thing that we were considering was that this thing is kind of more for right time. Yeah. So we might want to do like another model, another version which is like exactly the mirroring match of this one. Yeah. That's going to be a problem because you don't always have all left handers or all right handers in a family. Yeah. I think it's not a huge problem because I think left handed people already used to discrimination anyway. So they just... Yeah, but I mean because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left handed people can't normally write, write a hundred, but they can normally do most things, write a hundred, say. Right. I would say it's not such a big issue. Yeah, because I mean anyway right handed people would be able to scroll with them. Yeah. So if the majority are right handed... I mean, you think of it to scroll rather than you thumb. Yeah. So I mean that does kind of negate the whole RSI issue. So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation. I'll give it a little bit of RSI, what do you think? Or maybe six because it's just one, one in one of the... Yeah, I think for, I mean most people are right handed so in terms of our greatest target group, I think it's pretty good. Yeah. One more thing is that... When more things are planned for management, they might want to... Okay. It might be a little clumsy when it opens up, right? Or it opens on the side. No, yeah, but we have it nicely with our hinge with her what yeah yeah so it won't be a problem it will be and it will be it won't be heavy I think the alternative is flipping from the top yeah but it's a bit long kind of really a little bit long well I mean it can be open like this of course you were thinking about making it smaller yeah this is just like this makes more fun so you have to do it might interfere with the higher channel yeah but if we flip it open only ask much us that okay so it works like a mobile phone flipping but you know as long as that side flat then that will work okay okay so see oh are we admitting defeat on sea or are we saying we're gonna stick locate on the sea no we have a look at that there's a located cool so that's just take that TV that does mean you need to speak on it yeah well but but the speak sample speakers included so it has some capacity to do yeah so yeah so that's seven years yeah yeah fabulous day intuitive completely intuitive if this means intuitive if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's yeah I think it's six because I mean the the standard layout for numbers is 333 and one rather than the way you've got it I really like the way you have it yeah it's not the immediate thing that you used to yeah and I mean and even the scroll it's a new technology so might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginning so it is kind of not very intuitive but it's a good technology I mean something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places and so should we maybe say a five and say it is intuitive but it's different so yeah do you know I mean it's obvious how to use it but you might have to think about it first so we give that one a five do you think yeah can't give us seven and everything so yeah I'm glad you were accepting this I have taken a little while haven't I'm intuitive but sorry it's really hard to write on this I just went a bit mad didn't I okay cool E okay I guess this comes back from this whole B thing links in here so possibly for left-handed investigate yeah but otherwise it's superb so she give it a six six six the ergonomic design well I mean I don't know I mean the repetitive stress things but then who would be really pushing the button so much on the remote control anyway yeah yeah unless you are all the time sitting yeah so it's kind of yeah I think it is a lot of it you know and I never got the repetitive strain injury from that so I find it quite hard to believe you know and more of it it has the LCD and everything so that you know we minimize the pressing of the buttons anyway okay so we give that six yeah okay yeah have more that's absolutely I want to have a make showing up with the things there but it only have full of points there oh that's the second one so you must have changed it on this one where it's got score but not on the previous slide oh okay cool um right it has voice control yes so that's a seven then key in a way yeah in a while it's the most sophisticated mode that I've ever seen yeah but in terms of the actual technology none of it is actually well we have we have the sample speakers yeah yeah I mean all of the components have been used in other things before but at the same time they all they're all relatively new they've never been used in remote control before I didn't think yeah yeah yeah do you think six six I mean how how far can you go with our remote control really well that's it still has to do what it has to do yeah yeah but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really haven't it see many we've faced remote they can take it with them put fashion in electronics yeah it's in a touch on yeah sure the carrot banana it's the maximum we give it seven fruit and vegetables are fashionable they stay so okay so I think that's a fun one but good we need the average here so you know they ever reach us about six and something yeah a little bit over six there are how many six things a little bit under six that's 28 three sixes and one five 18 oh three sixes okay yeah 28 38 or four seven six 26 and five 61 21 to weigh six point something yeah about six point five six point five and close enough yeah okay that's pretty good I think now I won't until we get to find out if we can afford it that's all you've got at the moment or did you have anything there now that's it yeah all right so finance and we'll see if we can unscrew this fast would you get it? cool things I'm just gonna just get there again there's a Mud beautiful not in the culture If you have to wait for it? You have to wait for it. Okay, so we've looked at the project at presentation and the simulation criteria. Now we have to calculate the production costs. So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that. Can you read that? Almost. I started feeling at the end, but of course these are provisionals that we have to go down. No hand dynamo, right? No simple battery, no kinetic energy, no solar. The chip we're going for an advanced chip on print. We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker. Single curved surface, so that we can evolve it. Case material we said rubber oven. I don't know what special colour means. I think this is probably special colour. Rubber comes, rubber comes. Maybe if you want titanium colour, or maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing. Yeah, you might end up having to take off. We have a pushback and then we have scroll wheel as well. So we had from using yeah, and we have LC display and buttons supplements. No. We're not giving any more. Yeah, but we have LC display, but the ceiling will be there. Maybe it's integrated with LC display. I think the push button. I don't know if that's why. I mean you can only have 25 push buttons in two to do that, not counting anything. So we put it. What is the limit? Whether push button means that we have to count all of our passion. I don't think so. No, it says what is the kind of interface? If it is push button, then you got a 0.5, it's a scroll wheel. So we put it's push button and scroll wheel and LC display. So that's the three kind of interfaces that we have. So as we can see, that's way too expensive. What's our budget? 12.5. Yeah, the sample center will have to go because that's my sister. So that has implications for the. It does not have four wise recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker. When you press one, it says one or it says hello. That's a bit of a gimmick anyway. And the locator also goes away. But it was very innovative. So innovative. Well, I mean, the sample speaker is expensive, but we could just have some very easy device that just beeps. Yeah, because the sample speaker was, I think, more complicated than the other. But yeah, there you record your samples. Yeah. Also, in the case, I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface because it's just rubber. So it's probably a flat surface rubber. Okay. Yeah. So we need 150 off. See, I was going to say the scroll wheel push button thing because take it down to just a scroll. That means that we cannot press. Yeah, then we will be in the budget in the LCD. If in the LCD, we can scroll right. How do we make a selection if you cannot push this one, but we don't have a push button. We don't have this muting mechanism for this. Well, you just have to scroll it straight down. So that's the point. But hey, it's the scroll wheel. I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and push button thing. But I mean, we can put an additional mute button on the top as well. Yeah. I mean, that wouldn't actually cost anymore. That's the spin wheel, though, isn't it? And that comes with the LCD. That comes with the LCD. Yeah. So we are adding costs for both, right? Okay. I mean, I think it's the good. So we're pointing three over. I think we're over at the moment. Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have push button to the volume. We can still put them on the side. Yeah. I mean, the scroll wheel is pretty cool, but... Instead of scrolling here, we have two buttons here of rough and down. Yeah. For the side. Sounds good, actually. Yeah, rather than having three different things that people have to do. Okay. There we go. Oh, look, we're way under budget. We'll make huge profits and we'll get bonusy. And we'll be kidded to the single curve this time for me. So we're going to have a little bit of a special colour. Yeah. So that's all right. We'll leave it at that. Yeah. And then I'll take it. I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour. If that costs extra, we've still got some space for it. We have. Yeah. Excellent. All right. So did we lose on our evaluation criteria? No, I'm not really. You know, because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep LCD display. Yeah. Instead of having scrolling, we just put it in the back. We just show what is the gimmick. There's never now anyway. Yeah. And this scroll wheel is, I mean, essentially the two buttons that is, is not very different. Yeah. All right. But we lose the locator. Well, we are going to have a beeping thing. So instead of the speaker. Yeah, it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep. So we still have the little key. Yeah. That's not very exciting colour. I think you should make it more vegetable-like. Much colour, the colour of the phone or the colour of the... Oh, the beeper thing. Well, it can be yellow as well, it can come in the same colour as the case. We won't have run out of that. Yeah, I think general sits over our rate. You know, your pen for a rate? Yeah, I know. I know, I have my pen. But only for a very short time. Okay. So it looks like we designed a banana. We've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting. So it would be good if we could just have a little talk about their project itself and how it went so that we can feedback to the management for next time the design of the product. Cool. Feedback, I do. Yeah, as far as creativity is concerned, yeah, I think there was room for creativity. The only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the budget we had. I think one thing that was lacking was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with. Yeah. And we kept adding things randomly. Yeah. So how do you know? If we don't have the sheet at the beginning, you should have been like, okay, so we can have that lots. Yeah, yeah. We can have that lots. Yeah, yeah. So all the random decisions at the end could have been. Yeah. But in terms of the process of going and working individually and then coming back to the meeting, that works. I think it means to say regular, you know, it wasn't like we were alone for very long. So you didn't go off and think, wouldn't it be great to have a fine meeting? I think we could talk. Shape like a banana. And then, you know, come back, feed it, you'll eat it again. And look, look, get by bait and it looks like a banana. Yeah. Yeah, the means were very, very good. The means we used. The whiteboard digital pen. And the pens. I like the pens. I want one. That would just be so cool to do. You know, you could take it to lecture and just black stuff down. Yeah. I think that's it. I wonder what one of these costs. Do you think they've noticed it one day? Maybe you should say that was the recording. Okay. It covered my camera. Yeah. But that worked well having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint. Because I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it. It is a bit too late, isn't it? Yeah. And this time also, the time in the way to actually preparing them. The thing flew in. You didn't have the whole pushing thing because there wasn't time for that. Yeah. That's alright, otherwise it would have been tough. Not that you can do that on the board either. You can make some of it. Yeah, but I mean already just, just preparing the slides before the whole day. Yeah, totally. I mean, I'm just fairly tight. Anyway, I mean, especially with that last minute alteration. Yeah. And you can see the brackets. This has just had to be changed. And yeah. It's very cool. Yeah. We used to say nice things about gender. You don't move until I'm asked if you can. Yeah. I was satisfied with what I needed to. Yeah, definitely. You were in like a dictating reader. Yeah, that was always good. You have to say that because I'm taking the note. I leave the room and you can leave it in the night. And then you've got the pen. You want a tag here, then. And then the teamwork, I think it worked quite nicely. Yeah, to anyone feel that they were getting covered up. And not being able to express them. I guess it was a fairly small group. So all of us got to express our opinions. New ideas for me. Well, it's pretty new, pretty novel solution for remote control. I think the most controlled really, all this flipping open thing. I didn't know I didn't do shopping for my controls. I would have never seen anything. None of my examples were like this. Yeah. I'll be looking up next time I need to be an essay. I'll be exploring. Maybe we could have a patent on this one. Patent patent patent patent. I think the idea has been evil. We've got nowhere to find here. Well, you can always go to Google and type in the Nana Remote Control. The vibrate. The vibrate. Yeah, but that would just come up with like, the thing to nothing. True. Okay. So costs are within budget. Yes. Within budget. Including one of the got one euro left over. Bit that we didn't foresee. We've evaluated. Yes, the project. You've got the scores. Can you put that in the project documents? It's in the project now already. And the process we all didn't really have an emergency gobbling to. Was there anything that you found difficult or anything that didn't go as smooth as? My mind difficulty was the time pressure. Otherwise, sometimes it was like a little bit less. I thought that was good though, because if you're given too much time, you've got nothing to do with your time. Although we could have made the hours better, had we had time for you? Yes. Okay. I think we're still ready. I've got about five minutes left, but if we finish, then we're finished. Which is too efficient. We should never drag a meeting on just because we have extra time. Yes, so I would say that's the end of that meeting. It was a pleasure working with you. It was very productive. We took four animals on the board again. I don't think so. It can make some animals. It's just me and it smells so bad. Doesn't it? It smells very sweet. So we have to complete the final questionnaire meeting summary when they... Is there a questionnaire already sent? No, it was a bit... I can see it a bit. I can't see why you can't stay here. I can't see it. I'll put that side this way. I make your animal for you. It was supposed to be pink. Yeah, but it was little...",
        "abstract": "The project manager opens this detailed design meeting by going over the agenda. The designers present the prototype, which they decided to make the color and shape of a banana. They demonstrate the remote components, showing how it flips open on the side and features a LCD and scroll inside. The marketing expert gives the product evaluation, which is based on the criteria of attractiveness, whether it matches operation behavior of the user, locatability, intuitiveness, ergonomic design, and how technologically innovative it is. They rate the product using a 7 point scale and come up with an average score of 6.5. The group goes on to calculate the production cost and finds they are over the budget. They have discussion and decide to eliminate the sample speaker locator and the scroll wheel inside. The team discusses the project process- saying that they had to cut out some creativity in order to meet the budget because they had not known the cost of features beforehand. They were satisfied with the leadership but felt rushed for time. They finish the meeting 5 minutes early and the project manager tells them what is left to complete.",
        "actions": "The team needs to complete the final questionaire and meeting summary.",
        "decisions": "The remote will be black/yellow color and the shape of a banana. Remote flips open on side. LCD and push buttons inside flip-open door. The LCD will display the main menu, which offers various options. Has an on/off button, channel flipping, volume scroller on side. Corporate logo will be in grey. Remote uses one simple battery and an advanced chip. Single-curved surface. Rubber case material. Locator will have a beep instead of a speaker.",
        "problems": "When rating the product on how well it matches the user's behavior, they found that the product is more convenient for right-handed people and less so for those who are left-handed. When rating whether the product is intuitive, the layout is different,a good technology but less standard. It could be more difficult to get used to. The team had to cut out some features in order to make the budget. This happened because they had not known beforehand the cost of such features."

        "transcript": " Hey. Okay. Hmm. So okay. I don't know where it's but it's been. Okay. Is that alright? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right. Oh, another one. So that's this. Oh, okay. Right. Are we free to take notes? I don't know. I'm not going to say so. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just hang on a second, everybody. I haven't let you look at this yet. Very nice. I haven't looked at it but let's just start it off. Hey, we'll see what happens. If you're ready. Okay. It's the agenda. Opening acquaintance, tool training, project plan, discussion, and then closing. Project A is a new remote control. It's original, it's trendy, and it's user friendly. Project method, functional design, individual work, and then a meeting. Conceptual design, individual work, and a meeting. Details, design, individual work, and a meeting. Tool training. Try out the whiteboard. Every participant should draw their favorite animal and sum up their favorite characteristics of that animal. Okay. Miss industrial designer, would you like to go first? So we're supposed to bring the little things for the... Yeah, I think just click. Do you have a belt? I'll put them in your pocket. Yeah. Okay. So my favorite animal? Yeah, what's your favorite animal? Okay. Ah. Is it rude? An elephant. That's a very good elephant. Oh my gosh. I've never got a new straw that well. Okay, and you want to write up on there, so you've got to sum up your favorite characteristics of that animal. Okay, it's big. It's got a great memory. Is it? Oh, it's supposed to have a great memory. You say an elephant never forgets. And I don't know why, but it looks like nice to me. Okay. Wonderful. Well done. Do you want to use the wiper and... Wiper off? And... Is that a aesthetics designer? Do you want to go next? I've applied to your favorite animal. Okay, my favorite animal. Let's see. Oh. I don't know if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before. It's a Lager. What? A combination of a lion and tiger. All right. You've not seen Napoleon Dynamite. No, no, it's a hilarious memory. You have to see it. And it's best characteristic is... And it's pretty much the awesomest animal. But you have to see the movie, the fully appreciated. Okay, well done. Great. Me? Yeah. Miss Mark Singh? Okay. I'm going to show how this is going to work. Cool. Well, I'll try my best to draw... Can I just draw the face? Yeah, I think you can just draw the face, but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks. It's a cap. That's a very... Which also has a big fat body and... A long tail. Do you want to do some... Right. Do you want to just write some words about it? Why? Because... Cuddly. And usually caps are very friendly, usually. And the healing law, the heal. And they can feel when a human's... Wow. Problems. They're kind of spiritual. That's why I like caps. Oh, done. There we are. Sleep. Do do do do do. Okay. I don't actually have a favourite animal for the... For the... I think I'll draw... A little... I honestly can't draw for toffee. Really? Yeah. In fact, nope. It's just... This is a prairie dad. Nope. That's cool. That's exactly what it is. Not a very good one. Not bad, I would say. Yeah, that's pretty good. Okay, well you got it. It's a... It's a squirrel. And... I like them because they're cute. And stupid. Very good. Ah. Alright. Right. Okay. So, I guess that was the test to see if this equipment was all working. And let's move on to the next page. Okay, project finance. Selling price is 25 euros. I bet aim... 50 million euros. I can't read internationally. Full. Yeah. Production costs... Ah, it's got a bit... Ah. I'll cost any more than 1250 to make. I'm going to... I'll experience with... with remote control. So, I talk about who... Who's used block? Any ideas? Stuff like that. Next meeting starts in 30 minutes. At... Courage to 12. I think before we close, we're expected... I mean, the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer with our... What our ideas were... I mean, if you want to go back to the last slide. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think we're... I mean, before we close the meeting, we're supposed to come up with some ideas for... Oh, so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now. Yeah. Oh, okay. I thought this was just... given us instructions for the... to do next. Yeah, I think this is just the preliminary... get some rough ideas for... what our experiences with remote controls have been... and what we would... roughly what we would incorporate into a new one, maybe. Okay. All right, who's got experiences with remote controls then? For anybody else, everybody. We have our guests. Is this a TV one we're supposed to make? Yeah. Yeah, it's a TV remote control. Okay. Okay. A new remote control TV. What would I like? What? You want a big, do you want a small? Medium. Are we going for like... like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we're going for something that's... that's big and... That seems like there's like... there's sort of a tension between two ideas. I mean, you want... you want one remote that maybe can work all of the functions of TV. And if you have whatever associated with the TV, the DVD player... Video. But at the same time, you don't want a really busy... remote with a thousand buttons on it or something. Maybe... Yeah, I'd... I'd say other things is it's going to be cheap. Yeah. Because I... I mean, I was thinking something that's got different... like maybe a... an LCD display on it that's got different pages for different devices. But that would... that would probably be quite expensive. But how do we know how much... I mean, how much do we have per... How much? It can't be more than $1.250 per unit. Per unit, yeah. Cast. So do we have to be realistic within the budget for... Well, at the moment, we could... I mean, because we... this is what we're doing at the moment. It's just saying what we'd like. And then after we... after we found out what we can like, some different ideas... we can then go and do the research to find out if these... any of these ideas are feasible or not. So it would be nice to have something that controls lots of different things. But we have like... one that comes out. Like, so you have one in... like, it doesn't have to be really thick. I mean, rock controls can be thin bits. And then you have one for your DVD and you sort of slide it out. You have another one, you slide it out. So it slides. And then it all comes compact. Okay, that's a lie. Into one. So it's not... you're actually just putting three or four different remotes together... but making them thinner. And into one. Basically. That's an idea. So you just split them out. Okay. But have one very complicated one on one side with all the DVD and VCR... excess and stuff. And then on the other side, one... a remote control, though, would be very, very simple. It's just the channel program plus and minus. And then just the mute button, for example. I can really, really, really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated. One side for kids, one side for adults. I'm actually... Or grandma as well, you know. I'm going to show you if it's a good idea to have a two-sided remote control, because it would be very hard to use in the way that you... No, but you would slide it into something... like something on the back would hold... like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons. Like, or something like a flip telephone. Something like that, maybe. That'd be cool. I think you flip it open and you've got all the buttons or you flip it closed and you've just got their basic buttons on the outside, maybe. Oh, we've got five minutes left. It's still breaking up. Okay. Well, we've got a few ideas there. Yeah, we should... I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a rough conceptual. I mean, what was stage one was technical functions designed, what effect the apperata should have. Okay. So, I mean, we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface. But the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the TV but also devices connected to the TV. Yeah. We'll be able to operate DVD players, things like that. I've got... I think we should also have a backup plan of... I just think that it might be expensive to make something that... I mean, we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything. We should have a backup plan of just a really good television remote control. It's just for a TV but it's just a really good, nice one. What you reckon? Yeah. It's because I'm just thinking, apparently, we have to have something that's cheap to make. Yeah, that's true. Maybe we should just concentrate on having a good TV remote and have it be... I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker. Have it be like ergonomic, it's comfortable to use, simple to use, and looks decent. We know maybe... We'll make it... We'll make it interesting for people to buy, though. Well, maybe even something that's for disabled people or some people that don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for finding niche for our remote, like market it to a certain kind of people. Oh, just one that looks really fucking cool. Yeah, no, I think you're right. Could we really lie to... I don't know if it's something special. Yeah, rather than focus on... Otherwise, we'll be... We'll be here all day talking about how to do this and do that. I think we should... It will be the end of the day if it says just TV remote doesn't say combination at all. Yeah, I mean, obviously everyone... You know, it sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once, but remote's spinning out from other remotes. Yeah, having a little nested remotes and say, yeah, that's right. Yeah. I mean, I'd like one that makes tea as well, but that's not gonna happen. I think a flip-up thing, because you always have this problem of like... On this... Well, I didn't know it. Like, we had five or six remotes and they'd be lying on the couch and you'd come and sit down and... Oh, the television switch down or something. So maybe something that like... Does have a lid or closes so you don't accidentally press a button or... Okay, like a lot... Like a lot... Function on it like you have when you're telephones. Yeah. But make it like really snazzy and cool with people who want it, so make it, yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be sellable. Yeah, that's true. I mean, it doesn't have to have a flip function. It can just have a lot of functions in it. Yeah. Not usable when you don't want it to be used. Yeah. Okay. And even for kids as well, it's safer for them, I guess. Like, they don't flick onto channels that are not allowed to. They flick onto. No porn channel for children. Okay. All right, so we've got some ideas. I guess that's move on. That's move on. That's good for them. Oh, that's close. That makes me... What does ID, VID and ME stand for? Industrial designer. Okay. Which is... These are kind of specific. And on marketing. Yeah, there you go. So let's... Use the interface designer. That's... That's me. That's... Okay. That's you. So you're going to... You're going to be the one that's working out what buttons we need. Right. Industrial designer. You're the one that... You're going to be working out. Kind of box it goes in, I guess, or... Whether it's... I... What goes into the box somehow? How it works. And the marketing... These are quite... These are quite... So what the user requires... Yeah, what? And the art too, kind of... Right, okay, yeah. Yeah, it does seem like... I guess. You two... You two are going to... I think you just double... Yeah. You're working together. You're the one that's going to go and find out... Do the research. See what people want in a remote. What buttons are used more often and stuff like that. Oh, we've been warned to finish the meeting now. Okay. Okay, everyone. Well done. Good meeting. All right. See you in 30 minutes. Yeah. So... Do we take this off? I don't...",

Give her... The L-J. Okay. And your... I am R-I-I-D-B-S. E-I-S-A. Double S-A. Yeah, yeah. Right. Oh, good. It's just a bit nicer calling people by their names, I think. Right. Right. Okay. Okay, right. Welcome to Meeting B. This is going to go a lot better than the last meeting. Basically. Because I know what I'm supposed to be doing now. I am your project manager. And, yeah, I'm just here to... You know, sort of liaison between the three of you and get things going, get people talking. And I'm going to be making notes and sending them off to the powers that they have. Basically. Right. For the purposes of this meeting, what this meeting is all about, is... I'm going to have some presentations from all three of you, what you've been working on for the last... ...we-while, when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and... ...and, you know, filling out silly questionnaires and things. But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive. So we're going to... ...each of you are going to give us a little presentation. Then we're going to work, you know, from each of your presentations. We'll talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all. And then we'll do a sort of concluding, anything else that comes up at the end of it. How long is the meeting? This meeting, it's not very long. It's probably down to about 35 minutes now. So I want each of your presentations to not be too long. Five minutes? Five minutes, something like that. If you haven't done a PowerPoint thing, it doesn't matter. It's just, it just says that you... ...that's just one particular meeting. If you have time to prepare when you can draw stuff on the notebook, you can talk to us. You can, you know, however you want to do your little presentation, basically. You can. Don't feel pressurized into using this thing. Because I don't. Okay. So... You okay over there? Are you joining in with this meeting? Are you just doing some internet shopping there? No, no, no. I'm done. Okay, jolly good. Alright, let's have... Well, we all know that it's a remote controller we're going to be dealing with. I think the first thing we should look at is... ...probably the... ...what it is that it's actually supposed to be. So that's going to be you, Catherine. Okay. I'm going to hear from you first. Okay. Just connecting this. You've done that to worry about screwing it in just... Really? Okay. Okay. I've got a very quick care. Okay. So the working design, I've got a very quick presentation on this. So... Oh no, you can't see a thing. Oh well, I'm going to join on the board then. It's in blue and I couldn't change it. Wait, it's fine on my screen, but never mind. So the idea is that we've got the... ...energy source. Which in our case... Oh well, okay. Never mind. So I think maybe two batteries, I don't know what they're called, a lot. Six or something like that. And then... Then on the remote control itself will have the sender for the signal, which could be an infrared signal, which will be sent by an electronic chip. And the chip will be controlled by the user interface. So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel. And the sender will send to the telly itself an infrared signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels. That's it really for the working design. Great. Sorry, the presentation wasn't very okay. I prefer the... I prefer the hidden touch personally. Should I erase this? Do you want to just give us a moment? I just want to copy this down. It's fine. I don't know if you guys have any questions for Catherine on any of this. Of suggestions. Is a battery like the only way of... Well, you don't want it plugged in really. Yeah, alternate energy source. Like wind power. No. And you blow on it. No, because like, it's a power. Vicicle power. Always changing batteries can get like annoying the battery down. I don't know. So I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain. Yeah, it's worked for the last 50 years. One question I have and I don't know how much control we have over this is... As far as the infrared signal, do we have control over... How far away you can be from the receiving unit that the TV and still have it be operational? Maybe we want one with a strong signal. How far away is your television? It's never going to be more than... I'm not thinking... Unless you've got a TV the size of a football pitch. It doesn't have to go that far, does it? It doesn't have to go through a wall because you're not going to be looking through a wall. Yeah, but if you're on the phone in the other room and you need to tell them you're not there, something you don't really want to go into. Put the telephone down and go into the room. But we can like the signal strong enough to go through walls if you fancy it. I do not think about that. How about blue tea? Yeah. Instead of using infrared, it's blue tea. Why not? I just think that it's going to cost more. Yeah, I'm not sure. It sounds like you're going to use it. We don't want to overcomplicate things. We don't need it. It's a fancy idea. It's quite nice. But then I don't know. Either if you want to watch the tele, you're in the room. Yeah, exactly. Basically, we're designing marketing. Television remote control. We're not designing something that you can plug in a headset to and connect to your laptop computer and stuff. It's... Oh, we can keep the idea. We can see at a later stage, maybe. Okay. All right, well done. I think. Go, go for real. Let's hear from you on... Do you need the board or something? I'm just going to use the power key. Thank you. Technical quizzes.berg. Okay, so while this is warming up, notice. So I'm doing the user interface design. And basically, as far as methods, I was looking at already existing remotes, trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there, thinking of what we can retain, what we can do away with, what we can perfect a little bit as far as design. We don't want to do something that's too radical of a change, I guess. I mean, people want a remote that's familiar, that has their favorite functionalities, and it does the basic stuff. So we can improve what's out there and maintain that the basic functionality that we want. So things that seem like absolute must-haves would be volume control to up-down keys for that. Channel keys up-down, but then also a numerical keypad so that they can, there's key directly to the channel that they want rather than doing up-down. And a mute button. One thing that I didn't include here that I forgot that we talked about last time was doing some sort of block function. Okay. So I don't know, that's one possibility. And so in the research that I was doing, there's basically two types of remotes, ones that are engineering centered and ones that are more user centered. Actually, I don't know if I can access the web page from here, I can show you. So this is an engineer centered one. You can see it's rather busy, but it also lets you play your movie, stop your movie, fast forward all this. Breeze frame. And this is a user centered one. It's easier to just glance at this and see what's possible to do. You're not going to be staring at it for five minutes. Judging from what we all talked about during our last meeting, I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after, or the direction that we were going in at least. So the engineering centered ones provide a lot of functionality, but it can be a little bit overwhelming. So the user centered ones just focus on ease of use. And this sort of overlaps with the marketing person, Lisa, because we need to find out what people want before we make the sense. So yeah, that's me. Great. Okay. Now, I just have a question for you. We search that you've been doing, looking at other existing units and stuff. Have you found that anyone else has looked into the locking function? That seemed like a novel idea as far as I know. Obviously, another exists, like you said, in mobile phones. I was sort of inspiration for it. I've never seen that in all my years in business. I've never seen that locking function out. Do you guys have a year or an year on that feeling about whether that's really necessary? I would say it's... If it's simple to do, which I think it probably should be, even if it's a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote, even something like that, then yes, it's lower like, you said earlier on, a flip thing, something like that, but you know, being physical, looking to. I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centered at, well, something we should take into account is we've got to keep the corporate image within this remote control unit. It's got to look like it's in the R&R. The company is from what I can see from our other products, yellow with blue writing on them. In our motto is we put the fashion in electronics. There you go. I think we have to carry that mental. So it's got to look new and something fashionable if remote control. If telephones can be fashionable, then maybe remote control units can be. I think we can, so we talked about the layout in my presentation or what I didn't mention yet really is the sort of like the ergonomics. Yeah, I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here. Yeah. Everything is going ergonomic. You know, there's, you know, my three computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches, sort of, in the market, I guess. Okay, fantastic. Well done. Gabriel. Lisa. Let's plug you in, baby. Here. Yeah, the blue thing. Right, this is getting a little tangled. Make a sense. Sam? Yeah, then you just have to do function, effort, and it should come up. Oh, function, effort. Yeah, it did so well. All right. Okay. Let's have the slicks. Okay. Well, from a marketing report, we observed remote control users in the usability lab and also gave, so this is research. And we also gave participants questionnaires to fill out. Total number of people tested were 100, so you know, so that 100 people were tested. And these were the findings. So 75% of users find the remote control ugly. Okay, so they don't like the look of the remote control. 80% of them would spend more money if the remote control looked really cool and fancy. I think we all agree with that. Current remote controls do not match well with the operating behavior of the user. So they're not like the way they operate. It doesn't match how people behave. 20% of the users say that they only use 10% of the buttons on their remote. So probably if you have like one, two, three, four, five, the whole up to 10, they probably don't use those. They only use up and down channels. As we've only got five channels. Exactly. That's another thing. 75% of users say they zap. Not quite sure what they mean zap. They're flicking quickly between channels. Yeah, you want to navigate the channels quickly. It takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote, especially for the older generation. I know my grandmother doesn't like my smartphones. It takes ages to account it. Anyway. They also remote soft and get lost in the room. So no, we can find them. So maybe tracking devices is a good idea. Wow. You are a child of technology, aren't you? So yeah. I was thinking something easy to use, especially for older people. I have to look really cool flashing Ruby. People to buy it. And it's easy to find. So I don't know whether maybe. Also, we asked them whether they wanted, whether they'd be interested in voice activating. So voice activation. And this was what we came up with. And if you look 15 to 25, this is age. So 15 to 25 said like 91% of them said yes. So basically the majority except for the 45 to 55 year old. Some reason didn't want a voice activated one. And neither did the older generation. So younger generation who we are catering for. Like who have lost the money nowadays. Do you want a voice out speech recognition? But do the younger generation have the money? No. They don't. It's older generation than the ones they've gone out. Well, the 25 to 35 year old and 35 and the 35 to 45. 45. 75% percent. People from the age of 30, there's a big drop off there. 35. They're kind of saying yeah, they want it. But no, they're not the sort of most people that have the money. People from the age of 35 to 55. You know, that would be my guess. Because they're the ones that have been working for 20 years. And that said that's quite a minority there. So yeah, it's not even like 50, 50. That's 35%. These guys are going up. What about just from the perspective of our manufacturing cost? If it's 1250 per unit. Yeah. I mean, okay, those... Voice activation might not be the best. I would say scrap that straight off. Also with buttons, I think called RSI. So wrist sense. Repetitive strain injury. Yeah, repetitive strain injury. So they don't... I think people who watch TV maybe too often have a certain kind of talent hurts their wrist. Maybe this... So that's something we should have a look into then. When designing the ergonomics to see have a look if there's any medical background work and find out about this. But then you could be just touching... We just want to need to cover our asses so that people aren't going to do us in 10 years' time say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury. Yeah, we should probably consult with their legal department. Yeah. They're having a lunch break at the moment. Yeah. We'll see if I can get... See if I can get elder for the next meeting. I think we can do some really... In that department, the ergonomic department. Yeah. Make some really good improvements. Maybe the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press. That's where we just like flat buttons. Yeah. Okay. So that is me. That's great. Thank you very much for that, Racer. Okay, so we've basically... We've decided that it's going to... We're going for a basic television remote. It's going to be a safety use. It's going to look cool. It's going to be cheap. Now, going back to the industrial design of it, you know, we're looking at whether to use maybe infrared or Bluetooth. I think we should just go with the simplest option on everything. And that would be infrared, energy source, that would be batteries. We can look into using the little tiny, winy batteries, a lot special long-lasting batteries. But there's no... I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's going to last for 50 years because technology would have changed. You know, we won't have televisions in 10 years' time. So... I think we're all pretty sussed on that. Anyone have any questions? Everybody happy in their work? Yeah, it seems like we're on pretty much on the same page. Now, this is good. We've got a good structure going on. We all know where we're going to. Have any of you not been getting loads of crap spam on your computers? It's probably just you because you're the project manager. Just question it. Yeah, trying to sell your things. Yeah, but just stuff. Okay. Oh, have you guys found out if we can email stuff to each other? Yeah, you can. Right. Do you all know my email address? No, I don't. In the project announcement, you've got the addresses, I think. So project manager, it's part of one at... Can you all email me your email addresses? Well, it's... You have them, actually. You have them. But we'll send you an email. What's our friend, don't you? Yeah, okay. So are we headed towards a big yellow and black remote, as far as... Maybe that's our next meeting. Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue? I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background, but I might be just... It's like a white and blue on a black background with yellow borders. Okay. Maybe that's getting ahead of... Maybe you can come up with a few... With a couple of different ideas. How we have different colors and all that, so somebody can choose different colors. Well, see the thing is, we've got to keep the company image. It's got to say... People have got to look at this remote control and instantly recognize that it's a real reaction. But if it's RR, it would be a real reaction. Like if I... There's loads of companies that called RR. But this is the slogan. This is something that came on down from the high ranks. I mean, we're sort of beholden to them. So we have to have it one color. Well, not necessarily. Not necessarily, but we have to incorporate it. Not necessarily even. It just has to... But you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a Panasonic product. It's got to. So maybe... So you can have a look at our other products and see if they all follow us. Similar vein, perhaps. But it could come in different colors and have the RR colors just somewhere... Like just around the lock button could be the RR logo or Colors. Quite a pos... Yeah. Well, this is all your department. Okay. Well done, everybody. And I think we have... Stopped for lunch now. Yeah, pretty soon. I guess that's not... Are we finished ahead of schedule? We might possibly have done. Alright. See you all soon. If we finished five minutes before meetings, we're supposed to finish then that means we're going to next to five minutes for lunch. Okay. Yeah. There you go. Right. I just have to say there's a few little bits of pieces I have to write down. But... Take your head, set it off, kick back, smoke them if you got them.",

I've always wanted one of these, I really have. Which is beautiful. That's cool. That's cool. Alright, hello everybody. Back again for another wonderful meeting. Everyone ready? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I can hold on for a minute. Oh my gosh. Oh, wonderful. Oh my gosh. Oh, wonderful. I figured with the spam thing, if you can't enjoy it. That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to see. Yeah. I'm enjoying it. That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to see. Are you ready? Okay, right, I'll take it that you are already now. Alright, first off we'll just recap from our last meeting. Which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing and... who we all are and stuff like that. Get a bit more of an idea together of what's going on. What we're going to talk about in this meeting is... now that we know what it is that we're doing, now we know that it's a TV remote and stuff. You guys have just been off doing some R&D for that. That's research and development. I haven't heard that before. Learning all sorts of new tech, terms and technology today. Yeah, you're three little presentations. Whether they be on computer or on the white board or whatever you want. You have any preference order? I'd like to hear... I'd like to hear who's on the... from Catherine, actually first. What I'd like to hear about is if we finally decided on what sort of end you were going to be using and... I think she's still finishing her. Let's hear from you first. Where is that thing? Oh, sorry. What's that work on? Okay, yourself in position. Okay, so that's me again. So, for the energy sources, we can have a basic battery, a hand in a mode which was used in the 50s for torches. I don't think any of us remember the 50s, like a crank thing. Yeah, it wouldn't be very fancy. You can have a kinetic provision of energy which is used on some watches these days. I have just a bit of gentle movement that will give it the energy to work. Or you can use solar cells, but I'm not sure about that indoors really. Well, there's sometimes combinations, I mean like calculators to your combinations. But I'll also use some solar panels. Do you know the solar panel things? Do they have to work from the sandal? Can they work from a light bulb? Does anybody know? I don't know. I don't know. I think the cost of less would be the basic battery really. And if you want something fancy, I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice, but I don't know if it's worth the cost. So we've got to discuss that. Okay, totally good. For the case of the remote itself, it can be a general case, which is just a flat one. You can have a curved one or a double curved one. If you know what I mean. What's a double curved one? You know, kind of more, you're going to make that kind of sit the palm of your hands. Okay. Then the case material itself, so it can be either plastic or latex rubber wood or titanium. And for each of them, you have cases where, for example, titanium, you can't use it for if you're choosing a double curved case. We can't choose titanium. And if we're choosing solar cells, then we can't choose latex for the case material. So we just have to take that into account. But if we're choosing just the flat case, then we can go for anything. And I think we discussed earlier on the RSI problem thing. So we could do that. Well, that might be an idea of using the rubber, but then it's, you know, it's kind of squeezable, isn't it? Yeah. And also it doesn't break, because easily maybe I can. When a TV program's got, when you're watching the match and then you have teams just lost you, you can fuzz it across the road when it will bounce off the wall back at you. Yeah, I like that idea. So rubber, you think? I think rubber. Rubber, we're all going, we're all liking that idea. You think you can mark it, net? After my fashion thing, I think your real life is rubber is more. Ooh, we like rubber. Okay. And then there are the push buttons. So you can have basic push buttons or a school wheels, like you have on a mouse. Or you can have LCD, if you're displayed. And school buttons as well. So if you use a rubber double curved case, you must use rubber push buttons. So if we're going for rubber, then we have to decide for the case. And if we choose double curved, then we have to go for rubber push buttons. Well, we're going to go where we're, I think we've decided that it's going to be a rubber case. Yeah, but is it a double curved one or not? It's not a double curved one, we've got the choice for the push buttons. If it's a double curved, we've got to go for rubber push buttons. And that makes sense. Well, push buttons instead of the wheel. Yeah. If it's rubber, isn't it malleable? Anyways, I mean, it doesn't matter if it's double, I mean, isn't a rubber case, I mean, it's completely, I mean, it flexes to whatever they want. So what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubber double, double, rubber double, double, double. So, you've got, okay, the energy, that's one thing. I love a big neck, please. Then you have the case is whether it's flat or curved. And that's, we don't care if it's rubber or not, but then we've decided that we're going for rubber for the case material. So if we've chosen rubber, and if now we have the choice for the case, whether it's flat, single curved or double curved. And I'm just saying, if we choose it to be double curved, then we need to go, I don't know why, but we need to go for rubber push buttons. So either, I don't know, we just need to decide on the case. Let's have rubber push buttons, I, okay, go rubber. Let's go crazy. And then do I have a last slide? Yes, I do. And so the push buttons themselves, they can be just simple, they can be. So that's just the electronics behind the push buttons. Yeah. And the price that goes with it, so the simple push buttons are going to be the cheapest. If we get a scroll wheel that's a higher press range, if we get an advanced chip, which is used for the LCD, the display thing, that's even more expensive. Simple print. Chip on print. Chip on print is the infrared sensor. Okay. What I'm not understanding here is, okay, advanced chip on print, which I presume is like one PCB. And that's got all the electronics on one board, including the infrared sensor. Right. What alternatives do we have to that? Well, if it's not chip on print then, I guess you get different chip components and you build them separately and doesn't include the infrared, it's less expensive. Technically speaking, it's not as advanced, but it does the job too. So why would we not go for that? If it's something that's inside the unit, it doesn't, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So it doesn't affect whether the customer is going to buy it or not. So let's not go for it. Oh, it's along as it works. So let's not bother with the chip on print. So it's either the scroll wheel or the push buttons. Yeah. Yeah, push buttons. What about the sample sensor? What about what? The sample sensor. Well, what do we need to speak before in the remote control unit? I don't know. It'd be cool. They're saying they've just developed it. I'm just guessing, but it's going to be the most expensive option probably. The speech recognition option, it doesn't seem really very promising for us. Yeah, it's not something that we want to go into with the products. Yeah, the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine, where basically you can program a sample that when you say something, you could response and you could program their response as well. It's just clips that you record yourself. So you can program your coffee maker that when you say good morning to it, it says, hello Rick or whatever. Yeah. But I mean, it's not. It would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the TV on. Like, turn the TV on and it comes on, but it's not that it's just gives you an answer. Oh, it just gives you an answer. And it just gives you a verbal response. So yeah, I mean, like what's the point of saying hello remote? I thought it was one they say really lonely. Yeah, really lonely. I thought when they said voice recognition, they meant like channel five. Channel five. No, that would be promising. It's just a remote that talks to you. Oh, yeah, forget about it. Okay. I need to certain cues. Yeah. Okay, so I'll go back maybe to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem what we should choose. So for the energy source, do we go for the battery or the... Yeah, I'm fine with the basic battery. Basic battery. It's cheap, it's cheerful, it's worked, it does work. Cheap option. Are you happy with that? Yeah. So we'll go for the battery. Then the case, do you want it flat or curved or single double? We'll go with the later with the RSI rubber. Yes, we wanted rubber double curved. The... So it will look like something like this. Double waffle please. Okay, so then if we use double curved case, then we have to choose rubber push buttons. It's cheap, it's all round, it sounds kind of funky. And we can also mark it as... Because we were saying earlier in your research that people will get in the complain of RSI. And this is anti-RSI. Yeah. So that's another marketing point that we can use. Or the rubber push buttons. Do you have to... Anything's going to have buttons. Even if it's a jog wheel, it's still repetitive. I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or... You can still get repetitive strain injury whether you're pressing a button or pressing a flat button screen. It's the fact that you're pressing the same, doing the same movement. It's not actually what you're doing. But the fact that this rubber is actually used in these anti-RSI specific... Yeah, the rubber push buttons. We're giving them away to burn off steam, basically. Yeah. Yeah, so they can sit there and... And that watching TV should be that stressful. And you know, you can fuzz it across the room... Throw it at your children. Throw it at your children's point, if you're watching this book. Alright, that's me done. Okay, Gabriel. Let's hear from you about the interface. Yeah, some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about. Sorry. Okay, so I'm continuing with the user interface topic. And so basically, I consulted with our manufacturing division that sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them. I also took Reese's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration. Because I think that's crucial as far as what keys we're going to include, what buttons we're going to include, and how they laid out. And so the manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products like the coffee machine. So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface. I guess we basically vetoed that idea. It's pointless. It's just a sample sensor, sample output. It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the TV. So yeah, they also give the, they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an MP3 player like iPod. So we've already addressed that. I think that would actually be worse for something like RSI. I mean, you got that thumb move. Yeah, constantly doing that. Yeah, they're suggestion. And I have a feeling that we're interested in something more general, but they suggested going a little bit into a niche like either or having a remote towards kids where you could have a lot of colors. The keys might be, you know, funny or playful in some way or something for the elderly where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons. But, you know, we can, we can discuss this, but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general but done well. Yeah. So the key layout and design are really crucial. You don't want, you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without always pressing along one. And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last, I can give you an example here of good layout and bad layout. Manufacturing department. It would be an example of bad layout where you have volume down, but they have a V on both of them. So it's sort of confusing for the user. Do we have a example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose? Brilliant. So I think my personal preferences have all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page. So I was against the speed recognition and against going towards anything in the niche sense. I think it should be more general. I didn't think the spinning wheel or the LC display were more crucial for us. And, yeah, that's it for me. Okay, well let's, so what are our definite decisions on this then as a team? The interface type we're going for. So we're not going to have any sort of display. It's just going to be straight to buttons. I think we should have a limited number of buttons ideally. Power, channel up, channel down, volume up, one, numerical, keep that. And some sort of it will either have a lock button like we mentioned or a cover or something. Yeah, I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about it. We're not, yeah. Well, now that we've decided. Are we going to, and are we, are we decided on whether we're going to supplement it with anything, you know, colors or give me key bits to it. We're not, we're just going to go for something. It seems like we wouldn't want to make it too busy and to sort of, got it. Yeah, I would say maybe a couple of colors like a, like a black with yellow and somewhere like maybe the RRT yellow. Yeah, okay. Okay, Jackie. Yeah, I don't have any other questions on this. I guess the fact also that we are having a rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before. Yeah, sure. If we want to have a lock of some sort of, I think that should be, I mean, I can speak with the button department. But I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents the other buttons from operating. So that should be simple. Cool. Right. Well, I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets. Yeah. And what the fashions are for next year. So yes. So from looking at this is trends and fashions. And also recent investigation that we've done in the RUK control market. We have found that from the RUK control market. These are like most important aspects like that we really need to, which we've already probably discussed. And the most important aspect is look and feel. So the RUK control has to look and feel fancy than the ones that we already have. So it has to be. Yeah, why should people buy this when everybody got a remote that came with the TV? Second, it should be technologically innovative. So. What does that mean? Well, technologically it should be like work. Basically, I guess it should work. It should be, it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense. I mean, have something that's a little more technologically advanced. The trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already. Actually, I mean, these first two points we've already sort of done away from. Because our rubber one is not fancy. I mean, it's different. But I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy. If that's what people want, then we're going in the wrong direction. And it's not technologically innovative, you know? Maybe we could. That's why I think it's Bluetooth. Because if you put up Bluetooth and there's a Bluetooth remote control, everybody's going to be like, oh, because Bluetooth is in thing nowadays. Like, it really is. People. And when it comes to marketing, that's what people go for. They don't really care whether, you know, at the end of the day when it works properly or not. Of course they do. Well, they do, but it's not. Well, 100% less your first thing. Oh, well, I'm not going to buy that because I don't know if it works or not. Yeah, but it looks good. If it looks good and it can just be there for decoration. Okay, well, what do you two think about this? Is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just synchronize it with other electronics? Yeah, what? I don't understand what. Yeah. That's basically what it allows you to do, right? Yeah. And then this is just going to give you all this has been used for is your television. Yeah, but I mean, people. It would, that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it. Which no television does, doesn't it? If you're looking at something that's going to be bought by people, you have to make it new, you have to make it. That would mean we need to make a television as well. Bluetooth, for example, in a volume, I think to connect, for example, if you get a call on your mobile phone, but your mobile phone is downstairs or something, you would get on your television, you being called by this person right now, things like that. No, that would be your telephone syncing in with your television. Yeah, that wouldn't be very much. Yeah, I mean, if you get Bluetooth on the remote, you'd be able to... The television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible, basically. And there is no such thing. Like, it doesn't have to be, you know, Bluetooth, that was just an idea. But like, it needs to be something that, you know, is new. Whether it's a battery, it could be something really, really minor, you know? But I think we are really keeping to what is already out there. And people have already seen it, people have already got it. If it's something new, we need to move away from what we already have. And maybe the kinetic... Just go creative. Provision of energy, then. It's been done for watches, but I haven't seen that for... Okay, but yeah, that's very good. But then you can market it. Never have to change a battery again. And... And... And this is all tying in very nicely. The fact that it's made out of this rubber, we can throw it about. We should encourage people to throw their remote controls about, because it charges itself up. Yeah, it's an illegal character, as you say, but not too much. But yeah, by the squeezing it... Then we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the generating... Yeah, that's a great idea. Well done. Third, most important aspect. Is it easy to use? And I think we've all... All about that. Work set that. Okay, in the fashion, how it's supposed to look next year's fashion, very much in fraudulent vegetables. Are they like being themed for cloths, shoes and furniture? So next year people will be buying. I found this really funny. You know, strawberry shaped chairs. So we can have keys that are like a broccoli key and... Yeah. And an avocado. I want to watch the pineapple channel. And as it's rubber, the feel, which is in this year is spongy. So it's not quite spongy. Well, spongy, that's where we got it. We're ahead of the game there. Yeah. And so, personally, what I was just saying, we're from the current remote controls, like the look and the feel of the current ones. And change the look and feel while still keeping to the company's image. Basically. So yeah. Okay. What? I have to say. So we're moving in the right direction. Oh, yeah, no, this is good. So through all that, we're going to go back to going with the kinetic. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. Using the spongy rubber that we were talking about, that's anti-RSI. You can, as you squeeze it, you're not only thorough-putersizing yourself. You are charging the batteries. And I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit, though. No vegetables. Oh, yeah. Bob, maybe make it like fruity colours or something. Or the power button could be like a big apple. So yeah, but upward, so you're like, Bob. Yeah, this is true. They don't own all images of apples. So the Beatles, though. Okay, we'll make it a pomegranate. I think pomegranate. Well. Okay, it seems like the only thing that we haven't really fined. A grey down is image. Like, yeah, we're saying now we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables, but we don't know what it should be. Or like, we're going, yeah, it should look slick. But what do we mean by slick sort of thing? I think if it's rubber, it needs to be... I mean, you said earlier on that it should be funky. I think it should be... I mean, what do you associate with rubber? You know, like... Really different colours. Keep it clean. I'm sorry I used the wrong word. What do you associate with the material? That material. Like, I'm just thinking bright colours. Bright natural colours, nothing too bright, but not too bright. Right, yeah. Like, no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink. They'll make different colours, or anybody can do like... Like, the volume buttons should be the same colour, and the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that, do you mean? Yeah. And on the back of it, have the logo. Okay. What's easy? Yeah. Sure. Why not? Okay. The one thing I'm wondering about, I hope that we're not going too much down a gimmicky road of... Yeah, we're... If that's the reason to this store, they're going to see like... Three or four normal remotes and then a big spongy pink tomato. Yeah, I remember. What a nice remote controlled walk though. I can say, in this country, you'll get, you know, lots of people wanting something really funky and cool. Like, and kids will be walking in with their parents saying, wow, I want to buy that one. And parents will see the pro in it as well, because it's like... Kids won't break it. They won't break it more if you're thrown around. Especially with younger kids, you know, they can pick it up. And... Yeah. The only thing is, is that really small kids much on it. Well, it's going to be too proof. Yeah. So... I'm really ready to add that. It's quite like... Use a friendly and also for different families. Like, like, families as well. And for older kid like teenagers will like it. I think especially maybe younger girls, if it's in pink, they'll be like, oh yeah, pink, or a control for their room, something. So, what do you say? Maybe we should mark it in different colours. Yeah. For different. So, we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range. So, like, you walk in, you're like, oh, I like that remote control, because it's so bright. And then, and then the shop assistant comes up and says, oh, what colour would you like it in? They go like, oh, I can do the colour. So, they put, I think, even the customer into more control of what they're buying. Instead of, you've got all colours, I'm that or nothing. So, they also get to pick. Well, personally, I like walking into the shop and choosing a colour. I mean, that seems to work well with products like iPod, where, you know, you have a variety of colours that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it. Do you, although I'd be curious to see how many, you know, there are some colours that I would never choose, and I'd be curious how many people choose that. Well, I think that can be down to bit of market researching, you know. That's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular. Produced less of the colours, right? Okay. Alright, well, um... Alright, let's, what we're going to aim to get together by the next meeting then. Um... Is... From UCAS, you know, you're going to be working on the look and feel design. Yep. Gabrielle, you're going to be working on, you know, come up with the user interface design. Then, basically, you two are going to be working together, unless you won't be going off to your separate offices. Um, and I think you're going to get a chance to play with some clay. Alright. I think, yeah, it's going to be... You know, come up, cook, you know. For the next meeting, be able to come in and show us some, some, some physical ideas. Because at the moment, you know, it's, it's hard. We were kind of going, yeah, it's got to feel nice. It's got to look cool, and it's, you know, now we can actually start. You know, some sort of physical, something or other. It sounds good. Um, and you're going to be working on the product evaluation. Evaluate. And I... We'll be talking to the bosses, basically. And, uh, fielding off some more spam. And, uh... Great. That's it, really. Keeping things to... Well, you know, hopefully, keeping things together. Um... Yeah, that's... This is, this is, uh, good. So we know for definite, you know, we've, we've now got some definite things going on. We definitely know how it's powered. We definitely know that, um, it's going to be as simple buttons. We're not going to be going for the new technological chip on print, the expensive things. So we'll keep the costs down. It's this rubber casing that we can sell as. Um, fun and funky. Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff. People, you know, people are saying, oh, standard stuff gives you repressive strain injury. Well, this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite. It's supposed to fix it, rather than cause it. This, you know, we're going to, we're going to, as a sort of extra something on it. You know, what, what extra things, other extra things this product have. We're going to look into this lock key, facility. I mean, whether or not it happens, it's always possible. I don't know, but something to look into. Okay, I think that's, um, well done, everybody. Anyone have any, uh, any questions everyone know what they're doing? Because if you don't, I'm sure you'll soon get an email about it. I think we all know what you need to do now. Excuse your little detail. Okay, right. Well, it's, um, we're still a couple of minutes until our meetings due to finish. But, um, I got a note saying that you two were going to be working together. So, okay, I'll stay before you all disappear off. I'm just, I'm not even ready. Hold, hold fire. Does the peer is immediately come into effect on our next paycheck or is that? Um, I think it's, uh, yeah, I think it's going to be part, part more of a profit sharing on the product. It's a bank, you know, we're getting futures in there. Yeah, I think it, I think that's, I think that's the way it's going to happen at the moment. So we really have that incentive to make this remote work. Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits because that's what we're doing. I want to share in the spice rocket. Did you see that this company's sense of, we might have a spaceship. This company has, it's, it's a figure of a lot of different parts. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, what I find out in the money making department. Well, I, I did notice looking at, I mean, they told you that they wanted what our product to represent the RR brand and to be immediately noticeable. I mean, if you look like at the coffee maker at the corporate webpage, it's not obvious. Well, it is to us because we worked here for years and we used that coffee machine, but it doesn't have the color scheme of the company anywhere on it. Obviously, it's just so-so-burned black. And the spaceship doesn't have the- do you think they have a massive hour and hour down the side of it? I still want one. Okay, I've just had a sign, flashing up saying, finish the meeting. Yeah, I guess that's us. Yeah, it's not saying do anything in particular just yet, so maybe you should go back to your own offices. Okay. Are we taking this off? Yeah. Yeah.",
        "abstract": "The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries, materials, and components, as well as restrictions involved in combining particular materials, components, and batteries. The team then discussed and decided what materials, components, and what type of battery to use in their product. The interface specialist presented examples of existing remotes on the market with good and bad layouts and stated what features the remote required. The marketing expert discussed research from trendwatching reports, finding that products now require technological innovativeness, a fancy look and feel, a spongy feel, and a fruit and vegetable theme. This lead to a discussion on whether to use Bluetooth or infra-red technology in remote. The team then discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the remote.",

        "transcript": " Played out. Played out as edible. Did you know that? It's definitely because kids. I just do. Definitely eating it before I had it not less. Yeah. But it's it's my edible because yeah it's my edible because kids eat it. Yeah. If it wasn't edible then well no more better. I still make sense because I remember like I don't know if my mom ever did it. I remember other people's mom's making I come in and played over. You just like make the baby's coloring and mix. Oh yeah it is. Yeah. But everybody everybody ready? Yep. Okay let's have your um we've got let's get guys have the presentation. Yeah. It's pretty exciting. So everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber. Very simple and easy to use. Double curved. Yeah double curved. But also something that was going to jump out at people or something that would be different separated from the other. Remote's out on the market. So I think if you put this in the palm of your hand you'll see what a nice thing we have going here. That's cool. So basically if you hold it like that the one on your thumb. Yeah the thumb button is the power button. Index finger is channel up. Middle finger is channel down ring finger is volume up. Pinky is volume down. What's the big blue thing? That's the lock button. And then the M is a mute button. And then also has plus I said what button M for muting. And also there's an numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the channel if you want. So it's really basic functionality as far as what keys are available but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative. It looks different. That's it. It does. So all the important keys are right at your right at a convenient place for you to access them. So you don't need to. And to your side. Yeah it should be. And it's also conformable to the size of your hand. I mean if that's too big it's a rubber remote. Yeah. You can. Great. Is that what? Mesh with what you guys were hoping when for expecting on. I have one thing about it. But it's a small thing but maybe we'd have to make a white handed one and a left handed one. I like it. That's good thinking. But I don't see why that's not possible. If we build rocket ships I can't build a left handed one. Yeah. They might left handed scissors. Yeah. I didn't think about that. But then you can learn to use your right hand. Like I was thinking it's this left hand, there's hand right hand, there's in the family. What do they have to remote? I know people who have left handed and right handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole, the same computer for the first family and they have a house. Sure. Sure. Everybody using right handed. Yeah. I'm sure they'll be able to. I mean it's only pressing buttons. You don't have to do anything you know, extraordinary. I think I'm really going to press a button with the left hand, the right hand. Imagine are you right handed? Yeah. Imagine doing it with your left hand. I don't think it's too good. Yeah. It's not. But we can have both. Yeah. Have them in stock. Yeah. Yeah. Make them more appealing. But I'm other than that. I only know, and that's some, you know, that's just something I think. I think it's great. Yeah. Great idea. Do you think it says are I think it's I think it's well if the are motto is we bring fashion to the electronics. I'd say that could be quite fashionable. Yeah. It's got the black and yellow and blue plus red which is sort of a fruit vegetable. So that's that's our inner things. Yeah. Yeah. It's come up with what you know, the thing that's what we what we were looking at doing wasn't it? And it seems to be there. Well done. And all playing around. Before we move on. Yeah. I'm just do you want to plug in? I need that cable. Yeah. Um, one thing I do need to do we need to look at is the costs. The cost is amazing. The plan was very cheap. Well, yeah. I don't want to ask very long. Everybody will go like, oh, it's gone. But it's edible. Well, buy more than the heat. That was, I mean, criteria from the last meeting and have to be cheap proof. Yeah. Right. Okay. Now, I think we'll do this. Yeah. I could do, you know, I can do this. Oh, my God. I could do it with you, but it's just easy enough to go through it with you. So, we're going for the kinesic power. And the electronics we decided on it being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it. The case we've gone for the double curved. Um, and it's made out of rubber. The interface is push buttons. And button supplements were all there. They're special colors, aren't they? Yeah. Special colors. Special form. Yeah, they're special form. They're in shapes and stuff. Yeah, I mean, these these ones on the side are curved to kind of stuff. Yeah. Um, they made out of any special material. No, they're not, they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber anything. They're just simple. Well, they're rubber. Okay. So let's see if that comes within budget. And it does. That's going to cost. Yeah, that's going to cost 10, 10 euro, 70 cents a unit to make. And I'll tell you it was it has come in at under 12, 50. Yeah. So, actually making a better profit when you expect it. This is all very, very good. The bosses will be very pleased. Okay, let's just say this so I can email it to you. So, it's very tiny. No, at least say it in the other, my dog kids. Splendid. Okay. So, that's messed me down with this, with this do that. I'm going to do what you were going to do. No, evaluation. Oh, yeah. This is where we all get to, I get to write them the boops and the board. Oh, right. Oh, it's function. Okay. I love this, my play don't. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't spell it. Okay. So, evaluation. We're going to do it all together. So we evaluate it each criteria. I've got the criteria. And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true. So, it's, it's more like it fits the criteria and seven being, as in it doesn't fit the criteria. And the criteria are, and I'll draw this up on the board. So, we have a box. Just so we know true. And this is false. This is just like keep you informed. So, seven is here, and one is here, and then you've got in the middle. So, the first criteria, do you all get what we're doing? Okay, cool. Okay. First criteria, look and feel. So, it does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about. Is it color wise and is it spongy? So, what mark should we give it? I would give it a seven. Yeah. As in, it's not. Oh, sorry, one. So, I'll just write criteria. I'll give it a one. Second criteria, new technology. How we implemented new technology was in the new high tech. Yeah. That was our main technological innovation. Everything else is fairly simple, but the fact that we use the kinetic energy is new. It's ergonomic. Yeah, but that's not a technical thing. That's another thing. That's another marketing thing. So, on the technical side of it, it's about a twist in the middle somewhere maybe. So, criteria three is easy to use. I think it's the one. I'd say it's, I've not, if you're left-handed, it's not. I would give it a two. Two, six. Because it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people. But if we make a right-handed and left-handed, then... If we're going to have one left-handed and one right-handed, then I would give it a one. Give it a two. Yeah, okay. Okay, criteria four is costs. I mean, under budget. So, definitely one. That was good. Mount the buttons. Like the amount of buttons, because people like... I'd say only the necessary buttons. So, it's a one. Yeah. Quaterior six. RSI is a good against. Yes. Very good. It's N-T-R-S-I. It's one. And criteria seven, which is the last one, does it get lost? Is it easy to get lost? I don't think it's going to get lost. No, but it is small. It's not the kind of thing that's going to slip between a couch cushion or something. Maybe it won't. I think they would... We would have two. Yeah. I mean, it's not fully, it's not fully like... No, I mean, it's not a one. I mean, you can still flush it down a toilet, theoretically. Anything. I mean, it's bigger than the average mobile, I guess. Yeah. The mobile's getting lost all the time. But then you ring them and find them. So... Okay. Yeah. So, that's that. That's the evaluation. So, I'd say... Yay. Oh, it's like... Old-systemed girls. Like a number one... Um... Number one product. Hey, we can't file. We've fitted all the criteria. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well done, Risa. That's that one. Okay. I... I think I just want to put in as project manager, the, you know, a little bit of praise for everybody here, for how they've worked on it. You know, both individually and as a team. You know, everyone's come up with their own individual ideas and their own different departments. And then come together and works in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, especially you too. That's all, you know, gone very, very well and... You know, it's been good communication going on. Yeah, during our design, and there was some... some heated discussion, but we kept... We tried to keep it cool and... Did you have to go down to the corporate squash court and bash a few bills about? We just had to squeeze our product a little bit. Fantastic. Now, you guys have been a great team. I think we're the, we're the envy of all the, of all the other teams. I think so, I think, you know, I think we've come, we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before. We're not just rehashing in our design. In four, in four meetings. Yeah. From your design, and meetings could be this quick. You know, maybe this isn't a simulation. Maybe this is actually... It's like, I think they're so neat or someone like that. They're just, yeah. They get things... Thank you, you're welcome, dude. Yeah. Yeah, we're two years time, this will be on the market. Exactly that product. We'll go, yeah, we design that, and no one will believe us. So, at this stage, I mean, is this the last meeting of the project? We don't have another one after it's gone. No, I think when this meeting's finished, like officially, they'll get a question there. Oh, really? To fill in? Or six? Just not summarizing now. I couldn't apply to the same list. I've got the message. See some way. I just reported that. So, there's no way to predict what... Because we originally had it as far as our financial goals. We had a specific number for profits that we wanted. It was 15... Was it... Was it 50 or five? I don't remember. But there's not a way to compete that. I mean, since we saved on that production cast, do we know how much we're making on profit? It gets handed over to another department. Well, our project was to come up with the product, basically. And just basically, is it within budget? When it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and the profits and all that, that's other departments. It's another team that actually work out the mate that we have invested in, just... Oh, yeah. The old one goes in the profit sharing. Yeah, that's it. You know, we've... We've finished now. We've made... We've designed the product. We've got the prototype. It's within budget. It does everything that we wanted it to do. It's new. It's something that is now there already. I think actually in one advantage of this is that after the... You know, after this bad of fruit and vegetables passes, this will still be a cool... ...fremel. You know, we're not... We're not... You know, tying... tying our cart to that one course. Yeah. But this is very remarkable. And that it is. It's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people to want that. It's... It's... I'm going to write down this somewhere. Oh, I put it in one of my emails that I've sent off. That, you know, it's remarkable in the sense that it's... Whilst all these other emotes actually do give you a pest of strain injury. Our one does the complete opposite. You know, so that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they ask us to come up with something new. It makes watching TV happy. Yeah, and if you're not having a good time with the TV, you can throw it about, you know. It's fine. It's kid proof. Just don't throw it other than the ornaments and break them. Well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that. No. That's right. Yeah. So, all in all, I think we've done very well. Well done, everybody. Yeah. You too. Drinks are on the company. In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we've all just gained access to. That's okay, you know. Yeah. That's it. That's it. Well, as far as I'm... That's it. That's it. Well, as far as I know. We haven't got the five minutes left thing yet. No. You ever want to play ice-bite? I guess it's probably better than we wrap it up in here. Five minutes left. That sounds... Should we call it a dinner? Yeah, I guess. I mean, we're going to get asked to fill out another question there. It's probably going to be the same as one we've done before. I'm not the authority to say that it is. How does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this? That's sort of using the pens and writing on these special pads and all that. I love it. I love it. I think it's cool. You know, wired up and vibrating pen and cool. Being watched. Your moment, Tashui. Well. I think, you know, I'd... Yeah, as we said earlier, I've not never seen that before. Yeah. Something that... The whiteboard. Yeah. The thingy. That's great. But a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing. I mean, it's an orn such a new idea. It would be different if it was sort of handwriting recognition stuff, but as it's not, it's literally that or come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text. Right. I think they do want to do hand-writing. Yeah. It's just the first step. Mm-hmm. The lucky tech. I guess we should end this as well. Ah, public. Yeah. Meeting the dirt. Yeah.",

I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. Okay, good morning, everybody. I'm glad you could all come. I'm really excited to start this team. I'm just going to have a little PowerPoint presentation for us for kick off meeting. My name is Rose Lundgren. I'll be the project manager. Our agenda today is we're going to do a little opening and then I'm going to talk a little bit about the project. Then we'll move into a quaintance just getting to know each other a little bit, including a tool training exercise. And then we'll move into the project plan and then we'll move into the project plan I know we'll move into the project plan, do a little discussion, and close since we only have 25 minutes. First of all, our project aim. We are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about. It needs to be original, trendy, and user-friendly. I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those. So we're going to divide this up into three parts. First, the functional design, which will do an individual work, come into a meeting, the conceptual design, individual work, and a meeting, and then the detailed design, individual work, and a meeting. So that will each be doing our own ideas when coming together and collaborating. Okay, we're going to get to know each other a little bit. So what we're going to do is start off with a MENA, Alima, sorry, Alima. We're going to do a little tool training. So we're going to work with that whiteboard behind you. Introduce yourself, say one thing about yourself, and then draw your favorite animal and tell us about it. Okay. Which one of those I have to bring with me? Probably both. I'm supposed to draw my favorite animal. I have no drawing skills whatsoever. But let's see, introduce myself. My name is Alima, which is in T.M. I'm from the state of Maine in the U.S. I'm doing Nationalism Studies. I have no artistic talent. How do you spell your name? I am A. Oh, and I guess I'm the industrial designer on this project. Let's see if I can get here. I will draw a little turtle for you all. It's not necessarily because it's my absolute favorite animal, but just that I think there's a drawable. You have the pretty little shell going on. Can you find Happy? There you go. It's a turtle. So what are your favorite characteristics? I like the whole heaven of shell thing. It's quite cool. Carry your home around where you go. Quite decorative little animals. They can swim. They're very adaptable. They carry everything they need with them. And they're easy to draw. Excellent. So you just go around the table? I go for an NZ. These are in space for the budget. I'm trying to hold my finger up. I should leave that one on that. No, you can erase the turtle itself. It might be nice to have them all up there at the same time. I'm not going to draw it quite this time. Is that a reason why that's not around? It's not real. It's real. Oh my God, that is an amenable tool. Yeah, the reason I like my house is because what that's called, I quite intelligent. And that kind of mistakes. We don't really know much about them. And I understand how they work. I can't control my contraptions with these. All right, I'm Jeffy. I'm from around DC, I just sort of in the US. And we're going to keep the deep sea sort of theme going on. Are there animals? Don't really know how to draw this. I'm going to draw this. Can you get rid of the water? Help. Sort of give an idea. I have no idea how one would explain this. I'm going to get some whiskers. Basically it's supposed to be a seal. You can imagine it in the water. I like them because they're like playful and silly sort of. Have a good time. I'm not going to try them for time. It can get me better than that. I'm Rose and I'm project manager from California. I'm going to try to draw this. I'm going to draw this. I'm going to draw this. See. It's definitely significantly harder once you're doing it. It's actually a coyote. Let's see. Give it a little bit of a snout. Is it over it, Ross? Just the cute snout? That's pretty impressive. I will all the time. So I really enjoy their singing and their really beautiful animals. Okay. Moving on to slightly more serious stuff. I'm going to talk about project finances. We have a couple. We'd like to sell it for about 25 euro with a profit aim of 50 million euro from all our sales. Because this is such, this is for television, it's a, we have a market range of internet, like it's an international market range. We don't have to worry about specifics. In order to make a profit of this magnitude, we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of 12, 50 euro. So we're selling it for twice. What we'd like to produce it for. Okay. Just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project, I'd like to hear about your experiences using remote controls. Your first idea is about creating a new remote control. What would be the best that you, what are the features that you really like, what are the features that you don't like, etc. I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the TV like you have to do one foot power of the TV and then like another one to get the actual screen on and anything else to get it all going. I don't know. Now they keep combining all different remote together and I don't know if I necessarily like that because I feel like you end up like multi-media overload. I just want to watch the TV. I always get fast. I'm sort of like devised to help you find it. I do. I do like because it's like TV and the TV player and it's a little bit harder. I guess that we need to get up and move fast. I think that's especially if you're someone really lazy like me. I find that they can be annoying especially a watch TV. I have a tablet that can hold one foot in the TV, one foot in the digital box, one foot in the digital world. I also make data. I think that we've been using a lot of buttons on them. It's just complicated. All I really want to do is switch on and off. Change the channel, change the volume. Yeah. I agree with having too many remote surround. My dad has a whole drawer at home of remote sort of various things. I don't know how to work half of them. What's important for me, I guess, is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons. They're not too small. I need to know what you're doing. One thing I particularly like is if you're not sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infrared here. I think there's a way around that, but I know in my residence right now that the television you have to walk all around the room to turn on. It's just simpler to just turn around the TV itself. If you're going to make a remote control, it should actually work for what it's doing. There's about batteries and things like that. Are there some remote that don't require batteries or do well remote require batteries? I would imagine all of them, but it's also we could use a lithium battery that would last a lot longer than like double A's. Those are the batteries that are used in a lot of MP3 players now. That kind of thing. It seems we have a little bit of a conflict over combining all the remote together versus having five different remote. You said you don't like having all the buttons on one remote and yet you don't want to have five remote. How do we work with that? Could we get something that just has, you know, doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or programs, other things that I'm not very coherent about, but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything. You know, volume control on off, channel changing. Maybe that spatially divides it. So it's like if you're looking, if you're trying to get the TV on, that's, you know, like the top thing on their remote. I don't know if it would be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're going to make it. But if it's like all the TV stuff is here, then all the DCR stuff is here, all the, whatever else you have programmed into it. It's all just in its separate place and that's like all the on buttons together. Because then you're like, I don't even know what I'm turning on. Yeah. And if you'd save the more complicated functions, maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day. Okay. So maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on off, channel changing volume, and another remote remote with all the special things. Because that is one thing that, um, remotes tend to have buttons that the TVs no longer have as well. So like you have to have them somewhere because you're going to need those special functions occasionally. But not necessarily on the normal. Yeah, it's going to be like control, the television. Good question. And if this device is just to be used for the television, would we even technically be possible to get the microphone in there? I don't know that yet. It's just the, just the television, television, television, that you might be following. It's a good question. I'll look into it. I think it's just TV. I mean, if it's ever taking it, just write it sad. New product, a new television or remote control. It's not like, you know, I wouldn't say, you know, think it might be more advanced than that. So we should, we should be seeing that it's just the television that they want to be. Well, I suppose it would be nice to have the volume recording stuff like that in the video that they're doing. I don't know, I'm like setting it up to be on it. So I guess we have to define what we're aiming for. If it's just a television, then that's a bit simpler because there's less buttons that would even need to be on it. Yeah. It's an idea that the buttons being available and large. Yeah. If you have older people or people like me that aren't very coordinated, hand-eye. It's really quite important that you're not pressing a small, like, teeny mobile phone size buttons if we can help it. Okay. Okay. Sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas. Might if we move on. Okay. Now our next meeting starts in 30 minutes. I believe we've actually been only working on this one for about 20. So we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like. But this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually. The Industrial Design, Alima. We'll be doing the working design. Use your interface designer. That's for you. The technical functions, I guess, like keeping in mind the buttons, the size of the buttons. Use your requirements. So you'll be hearing about different trends, about different things that people need. I guess kind of the same discussion that we've been having. We'll get from actual consumers. Okay. And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach. We did a lot of analysis in this past when we didn't have much. We just wanted to get a little brainstorming done. So, very excited to see all your animals. And how wonderful artists we all are. Any questions? I haven't gotten an agenda yet. I'll put that together. I'm sure as we'll each get our own instructions. Because what we're going to do is first our individual actions. And then we'll come back together. I'm sure we'll have more concrete things to contribute next time. I'm sure we'll be busy. Okay. I'll type up the minutes and probably email those out to all of you. Just including all the things that we talked about. Yes, I think I can. I'll just attach it to an email. And your number two, two, three, four, is that correct? All right. It was lovely meeting you all. Just make sure to keep checking the company website and the emails. And we'll see if I can do that right now.",

        "transcript": " Good to see you all again. Let's see if that can be done. This is our functional design meeting. Okay. We put the fashion in electronics. Okay, our agenda today. Just took time. It's 12.13. I'm going to do an opening. Talk about, did you all get the minutes? I emailed them to you. I'm also putting them in the shared folder. So, we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations. I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received. And then we have to make a decision on our route control functions. Finally, we'll just close. We're starting this meeting at approximately 12.13 and we have 40 minutes. First of all, the functional design objectives. We need to keep in mind the user requirements specification, what needs and desires are to be fulfilled. Detectional functions design, what effect the apparatus should have, and the working design. How the apparatus actually works to fulfill its function. Okay, three presentations. You can go in any order you choose. Should we go in the order that you just did it? Sure. Please do. I don't know. How do I hook my screen up? I think you might have to discus it. Yes, Rose. It's a function effect. Blue one, that thing. Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in? How wait, it's burned. I think you just have to push it in really hard. Oh, got it. I'm going to attach it to anything. There you go. I don't know if you guys are able to get access to the report that was online or if I'm going to put it on there. I don't know how to play this. Press the little presentation. It looks like a Y kind of over there above draw. There you go. Right. We're going to talk a little bit about functional requirements that people specified when they were asked. I guess real reaction did some market research. They were asked to use the word subject into their usability lab and they watched TV and recorded the frequency that they use particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had. What they found was they analyzed people's desires and needs. People specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly. 75% of the 100 subjects noted that and that they more importantly though 80% said they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote. I don't know anything beyond what fancy means but that's particularly of use to us I think. Also, they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age. So younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition whereas the older people in the like 60 and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition. People also had certain frustrations that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design. That being people frustrated with losing their remotes I think over 50% of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration. People were also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons it just needs to be easy to use. It also mentioned something called RSI and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what RSI is. I don't know. What? There we go. People did not like that sort of the carpal tunnel type thing. People did not like that. The repetitive use I guess caused a strain. Looking at the needs people specified. The problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behavioural. They are using 10% of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote. What people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume. People also zap, like change the channel, about 65% during an hour of use. We really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings, the screen settings and the channel settings because they are used much more and frequently and probably complicate what's going on. I think that something that we might want to think about. The idea of an LCD screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were. I don't know if that's coming to me later. I wasn't like that but something for us to consider. There are also just the phenomenon that lasts more when it comes to the buttons on their remote or what we want to make easiest to use. Make sure that something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on their remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often. Basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly. It feels like the way they're going to use it so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that. Thank you very much. That was great. Let's move on to the next presentation on effects. You? Great. You have a button to spare that? The user interface, right? I think that's in the shared if I did it right. If anyone wants to look at it, I'm going to put it in the video. Okay. I'm going to talk about the technical functions design of the remote control. I need to start by considering what a remote control actually is. It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television. So it's basically communication device. We tell the remote control what we want to do. It sends a message to the television saying change the channel, change the volume. Yeah, I just need to set it. How do we actually go about designing any television remote control? The first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications. We need to know what our final product is going to be like. So we need a clear idea of exactly what this product does, how it works, and what the end user is going to want to do this product. A way I'd suggest that we could go about this by designing several different prototypes to use of interfaces for this product. And then trying to get some feedback about how well these particular prototypes work. So by now what people think of them using a remote control is quite a subjective experience. And different people, different things. We should remember that remote controls are a fairly standard piece of equipment when it uses using a remote control. The computer expects the buttons to be in certain places. So in some sense we're going to have to aim for the device which is very conventional in design. So we're not completely shocking people. But I think within that there is also been just to introduce novel ideas and to make something that's perhaps a little bit different from some of those things out. Also in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities. The first of these is technological. What can we do with the current state of technology as it is? The second is economic. We need to find the balance between features and files. So as you mentioned things like waste recognition would add to the files. But it would also include the design of the products. So I have a look on the web to see if I can find a few examples of existing television and remote control. In analyzing these we can consider what things are good about them, what things do they get like, what's bad about them, what's wrong with them, how we can improve on the designs that are found. And what can we do to make up on that stand out from the large majority of the remote controls? Here's two examples, probably the extreme ends of the spectrum. On the left here we've got an engineering based design but remote control. So it's one that's got lots of buttons, it's fully featured. Everything you might possibly want to do is there. It's got forward backwards, up, down, channel numbers, volume, these things. It's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it. But once you've learned it, you can do whatever you want with your TV. The one on the right is a lot more basic. It's just got the essential functions of the TV, changing the channel, place, lock, volume. It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it. But again, it swings in and out of the bounce. The disadvantages you can't use it. It's a great way to freeze the television picture. There's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control. So we've got to find a way of striking the balance between the two. As I said before, the very controlled house objective, different people want different things. Personally, what I want to know about remote control is a device that's simple. It's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often, changing the volume, changing the channel. It does everything that I need it to. As I said before, I'm quite lazy. I don't want to walk across the beam just to adjust my television. I also want something that looks cool and that feels like this ergonomically designed. Thank you very much. That was very useful. It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes. Neither of them were very pretty. I think that could be our selling point. Fashion, fashion, the mode. Right. There's a certain market technology that looks cool. That's my company's app movement. I really can't see what I'm doing. There it is. Showing up already? Did it let you go on the internet? That was just funny. I was like, you're going in and I'm like, wait, I'm going to walk. All right. No, how do I play again? It's right above draw. It's with bottom. It's the one that looks like a desk. This is our working design presentation. I'm going to do some issues with this because I wasn't able to find everything I needed. But I guess that's, we're still in early stages. This is this. The thing about working design is what we're trying to do is working designers figure out how the apparatus can fulfill its function. One of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder. It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans. Then put the beans through a filter and that filters out. Then you get coffee at the end. That's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then other things that are brought in to make it work. I don't know if I'm explaining that very well, but how do I get to the next? The method as working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfill this practical function. What needs to be done and how do we convert all elements to make that done? The easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen. You make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted towards this practical function. Then I think the easiest thing to do is going to be work on each task separately. You just press the edge of the neck. The findings that I got very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver. In my opinion, infrared is the best way to do that because you don't need a sight line. That's one thing we're going to work on. The user interface is critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that converts the electrical energy into data. The chip that I think Ian is designing is going to be crucial. It all comes down to the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design. The components that we find here are the energy source, the battery, or whatever that's going to make it work. Then the chip, which converts the data, the user that's controlling the chip, and the infrared bulb that's going to let us move the data to the receiver. So you have four main components. They are designed sort of like this. You have your energy source right there, which then brings energy or information to the chip, which is also controlled by the user. So you have energy going to the user who is controlling the chip. That's not what I want to do. Use that thing down that you can go back. Previous. Sorry about that, guys. Oh, no, no, no, no. Okay, let's just get back to my skin out of care. Double click on it with the left hand one. Yeah, I am. I think it's frozen. Don't show me that. There we are. Sorry about this, guys. I'm kind of pathetic with things like this. All right. So you have your energy source, your user interface, who is controlling the chip. The chip also uses the energy, and the chip through the use of the user interface is going to control the switch, which will work your infrared bulb, which will then bring the data to the receiver. So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way. This is the parts of the working design that need to be figured out. And personal references, besides the fact that I can't spell, we need a long lasting energy source. People don't want to be changing it a lot. We need a chip that works well with the user interface that isn't too complicated. We have straightforward interface like Ian was saying, simple, not overwhelming it with information. And we need a reliable and clear infrared signal so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands. That's pretty much it for the working design. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Most do you think you can give me a hint with this? Yes, absolutely. Can I never tell you where to turn these things? Lefty Lucy, righty, tidy, righty? Lefty Lucy, righty, tidy. Never heard of it. Oh, yes. I think about every time. It's a good one. It's a good deal. Nothing on my screen. There we go. Lucy, yes. Requirements. We have a couple of new requirements that I was just emailed right before the meeting that we have to keep in mind as we're creating this. We didn't bring it up yet or at all in the meetings so far, but we're not going to work with teletext because that's been taken over by the internet, so we're not going to worry about that. What was that? It's a precious thing. No. Would you care to explain it? I suppose it's kind of similar to a very basic reference. You have numbers that you can go. You type in the page number one, so you type 100 and you're like, you're drawing and this kind of index is on the television screen. You just type a sentence and you're working with graphics and you just have numbers and you're going to send it to your destination. Oh, no. You're asking about the number of things you do that you should have. You're asking about the numbers and the score scores. But if you ever see the TV saying, go to page 160 on CFACS now, that's what they're talking about. So it's put your own time limit. Okay, I just want to explain why. I have no idea why we don't have it, but let's go. Interesting. I'm going to, the man decided we're not going to work with that. Okay. And we're also going to, like your question earlier, whether this is going to be for television video or et cetera, just for television. That's what we're focused on. Otherwise, it becomes too complex. We want to get this out very quickly. We only have a short amount of time. And finally, this is more marketing. I think our corporate image has to be recognizable. So while we're going to make it look pretty, we need to use our color and our slogan in the new design. So what's our corporate image like? It's kind of yellow color. It looks like kind of a yellow and black and we have that, the emphasis on the Rs in. What's the number of? Yeah. We put the fashion and electronics. So we've got to keep that in that in mind. Okay. So we want something that looks good. Yep. And it's yellow. Yeah. Or maybe some buttons could be yellow. Like we can play around with it a little bit. Okay. We need to talk about our functions and our target group. We decide who our target group is. You, in your analysis of the marketing, you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences. For example, that older people didn't really care for voice recognition, but younger people did. So who are we ending this at? If we're going to say that function fashion, we put the fashion and electronics, then automatically I think sort of younger group that's who's going to be attracted to this. We have to think who's going to have the money to buy it. It's going to be 25 euro, remember. So it has to be marketable to whoever it is. Well, at least right now what we're doing is deciding on just the remote itself. So it will probably be sold separately. 25 euro by itself. The only breakdown that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation. And basically there's a big jump after 35 people don't really care if it has voice. So it's basically 15 to 35, but I think that's a good idea. I don't know if I'm going to be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later, but if that's the only quality that we have that is divided into age, then we would want to stick between the 15 to 35 range. That's probably a population of quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway. So that might be a fairly good target group for us. Now, those are that's all specific for speech recognition. Are we going to use that as one of our functions? I would say no, especially if we are marketing. But I would say that we are going to be doing a kind of good thing. But I would go by the limit and do 12, 12, and a half years. To produce it? To produce it, yes. I wouldn't even go and get a place that the measurement would have been 12, and a half years. I would have nothing to do with other companies. But what else are we going to put? I mean, not that I'm really going to hold about it. I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though. So like other than just making it look good, how is it? I mean, it can look really great and still have the same up and down button in the mind than we're going to buy a new remote. Well, but why are we aiming for a technological advancement? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple, and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology. I think they could use lines. They could mean not. If they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology. If someone's looking to buy a new remote, don't they want like an upgrade? I don't know. Upgrade, well, we can look at Upgrade or we can look at user friendly. Yeah, simplification. It could have a crapper mode that came with our TV that's just impossible to use. Or maybe it broke or maybe they're just missing it. And we also need to talk about if we're only going to have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow. Or, I mean, this might be too complicated, but I wish I had some mind to explain it. If it was just a simple either the sphere of the spray that had the main buttons and then you could pull something out kind of and you got the rest of the buttons but the rest of them went in. Do you know what I'm saying? They were going to pull out of the side. Some TVs that have a small screen, normally they're like normal, but lines will be complicated. So you want to do something complicated, like on some of those you know the two, and you're open up this little hatch, you're only going to slide down and that's the best. Because then like people who don't want to ever look at them never even have to see them. And if you get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it, then you'll never even know that those things can pull out. And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes, one that has the easy ones and one that has more complicated ones. That's a good idea. It's all so in one. We have to be careful that that doesn't impede the chip transmitting information. Yeah. But that's going to be mostly a technological thing. Okay, so what are we emphasizing in this project? In the beginning, we're going to be focusing on the ability and fashion. Okay, those are very good goals, I think, that we have to keep in mind with everything we do. Simplicity and fashion and, or usability, however you want to say that, which includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional, so that you don't have to travel around a lot. What can you do to make the infrared more functional? Like why would it not be? I think it's a lot to do with battery, but that's just my battery. And that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well without sort of scattering. So it's just the quality of a chip. Yeah, I think so. The quality of all the components really, I mean, we can't really do anything. Shall we work? It's going to be visible down the line. So our target group, we're saying 15 to 35? Well, I don't know how useful that number is if we're not doing voice recognition. Yeah. Which I kind of, I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in our remote control. I don't know. Like it might be necessary for a TV, but not for the remote, you know, seems a little bit. Yeah, and it might be too expensive. And if you had a whole idea of using a remote, then why would you have a voice? Like, you know, it's like you would need a remote, you would just talk to your TV. Yeah. Oh. Ultimately, I think people are not going to be bothered to talk to the right people. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe, I mean, if I get more numbers, I'll email you before the next meeting in terms of age as. But this doesn't divide up anything. And there was only 100 subjects also. Which isn't, I mean, really, it's not representative, especially if it's 100 subjects. So that they then can subdivide into age groups. That means there's very few in each age group. I think regardless, we're aiming for the under 65 or something under 65. Okay, that's a good start. I'd say where, can we narrow down to maybe teenagers and families? Because that would go up to like 50 professionals or something. I think you'd go like 55. Yeah, it's hard to narrow down. I don't think you're out right now. I think the problem is, it's not built across the board by a generation. And we said simplicity is one of the features. So it's going to appeal to people. Maybe people who have problems with technology, they don't really get that. Okay. And that might be older people. But then we've also got passion, which is something that definitely is. Well, maybe we don't have to define this hard group by the demographic of age. Maybe we could define it by the demographic of how much money they have to spend or something like that. That's a good one. Obviously, that's to be someone who owns the television. And how recently have they bought the television? That sort of thing. So maybe it's more useful to just find objectives. Like, passion, simplicity, then to find specific target group as far as age. Because things will appeal to different people. Okay. Oh, there are a couple of functions. Do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost? Like a button on the TV, you can press in it or ring or something. I don't know, like, or beep. I guess I before 50% of the frustration someone could have that was the biggest one. And half people said that happened. And we all mentioned it before. We knew about it. And if we're talking about making something easy, that sort of goes along with it. So it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in. It would be relevant like the overall goal. Yeah. That's probably good. Okay. We have about four minutes left to define our functions. So let's do that quickly. So we want something to keep it from getting lost. Yeah. And we want... We want large buttons for the essential things. Yeah. Large, accessible buttons for the essentials. We want a possibility to get... Possibility to get the extra functions. Yeah. Which kind of fit in the way in some way. We're not hidden. We're not as prominent as the main features. Yeah. Hidden way. And we also want it to be fashionable. Which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a... Yeah. So I wanted to think I'm in coffee table. It's not like an ISO or that kind of thing. Yeah. Okay. Do any other essential functions that we need? Battery? Do we need a long life battery use? Yeah. I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really. But we never have between the batteries. Yeah. We should play very well. We should play very well. But we need a battery use. I suspect that we might be able to buy a battery. I would imagine just because it is an electronic device. I think it does. I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without one. But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone. Or like a little cradle for your iPod. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That might contribute to less people losing it too. It stays one place. I have to think about space in the living rooms too. Would you put it on top of the TV? I don't know. Okay. That's a good idea. We'll keep it. Let's just off the top of the head. It will be fun. Okay. Okay. We're going to conclude now. As everyone said, their functions. Okay. After the meeting, we're going to each complete questionnaire in the summer's summary. I don't know what summerization. And then we'll have our launch break. After that, we have 30 minutes of individual work. I'll make sure to put the minutes in the project documentation and including this PowerPoint slides. If everyone could do that as well, that would be great. You each have individual actions. I, ID, industrial design. If your components concept, user interface, the user interface concept, market trend watching. And as per last time, you'll get specific instructions from your personal coach emailed to you. And hopefully, I hope next time you'll be able to access more of the website that they seem to tell you that you could. Yeah. It's kind of frustrating. You sure to note any frustrations or any issues that come up in your, in your, um, summary. Okay. Okay. That sounds good. Great to know. That's good. That's good. Did you, um, were you able to, like, put yours in the group folder? Yes. I just did that. Hopefully it is there for people. Yep. Yeah. Looks like there are, um, looks like there's a second one kind of of mine. Yeah. That I do. It's from like an earlier project, I think. So, okay. Um, where is that? Under the shared folder. I don't know. It might not even be under your. So in there, we have technical functions, presentation, working design, presentation, and the functional requirements. At least that's why I have three. I just have like R three. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I have as well. Oh, you don't have mine. No, but that's because I think yours is in the email separately. Like it's not on the server. Yeah. Hmm. But if I open it and then save it, probably will be there. I'll wait and I'll remind you can't save. Okay. Well, I'll figure that out in the meantime. Okay. Okay.",
        "abstract": "The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda. The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of the appearance and use of remotes, finding that users wanted fancier looking remotes, disliked losing their remotes, wanted remotes with fewer buttons, frequently use the channel changing and volume buttons, and that younger users wanted speech recognition. The user interface designer described how a remote works and how to go about designing one. He presented two remotes currently on the market and the advantages and disadvantages to each design. The industrial designer described the interior workings of a remote. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion about their target group, the option to include speech recognition, how to find a remote when lost, and batteries.",

        "transcript": " Okay, let's go. Okay. Thank you. I'm going to start with the 1426. Okay. Lovely to see you all again. It's our conceptual design meeting. And it's starting at approximately 1425. And so we have 40 minutes for this one again. So we'll go just after three o'clock. Okay. Our agenda, we're going to do an opening. I'm going to review the minutes of the last meeting. Then we'll have your three presentations. And then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts. Finally, we'll close. So opening. These are our minutes for the functional design. We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it. Because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups, different functions of it. Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion. And in specific functions, we're something that we can do. And in specific functions, we're something to keep the remote from getting lost. Large buttons for the essential functions. A possibility for extra functions like a sliding piece. And a long life battery or a charging station. Okay. Now three presentations. I'd like to do it in this order. First do the conceptual specification of components, properties and materials. And then the conceptual specification of user interface. And finally trend watching. All right. Well. Okay. Function of it. There we go. All right. Well, I'm very excited by this one actually guys. I had a lot of fun doing it. Components design. This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control? And what should we make our specific remote control out of? So we need to examine each element separately. But we're designing a full thing. So you want to keep it integrated as a whole. And the main elements of remote control is in general in their far hours as well. Or the case, the buttons, the circuit board with the chip and the battery. These are all things that we had sort of addressed before. But we're going to take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like. The case, the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do. There's a shape of a case. A flat case, a curved case, or maybe even a double, double curved case. I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet. Just keep that in mind. But these are the options that we have for manufacturing. And we can make our case out of plastic. The main base will be plastic. But we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in. Wood, latex, titanium, rubber, or other colored types of plastic. That would be our case. For buttons, we have push buttons, which is what real reaction uses the most often. But we also have scroll wheels, which can have integrated push buttons. Or we could go all high tech and have an LCD screen. Circuit board and chip, we can have a simple one, a regular one, or an advanced one, depending on what our other needs are. And then battery, I think, is where things get most exciting. We're talking about long life batteries here. We can have your sort of basic AA batteries. But we also have these options of using a kinetic battery. Like, are used in high tech watches where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up. So simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery. Or solar battery, although there are slight complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery. Or something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about 50 years ago flashlights. Not quite sure what that is, but that's the description that I received. So that's what I'm passing on to you. So those are our options. Personal preferences that I was thinking through. Here's what we've been talking about all through, fashion and simplicity. So if we're going for fashion in our cases, I think that what we're going to want to look at is a curved or a double curved case. Probably with a variety of design elements. Maybe titanium, maybe some wood. We're going to have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials. That's sort of what I have in mind. And we want to go for simplicity. Probably push buttons, but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll wheel if anyone has anything. I have many ideas on that. I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll buttons, which are exactly like what they're describing. So that might be something we want to look into. And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery. Solar, I don't think, would be such a good idea because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light. But this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and that a simple just shaking around will make it work. I think that that would be a very interesting thing. But I think we'd also want to go for a simple chip or a regular chip to keep our costs down. We really only need a regular or advanced chip if we're going to start using an LCD. So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly technological if they don't need to be because that'll keep our manufacturing price away down. That's what I have for options. I'd appreciate anyone's input, but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the look of this thing. It's double curved. That'd be like two hands kind of thing. I'm not sure. I haven't received any specific visual information. It's a mess. Double curved is like two sides of the curve. This is what I'm sort of... This is what I'm sort of... One curve would just be a single vertical. It's kind of what you think. But I'm not sure. But I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures. I wonder. I know if we do have a double curved case, it can't have any titanium in it. But the titanium, they were quite... They were marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space program. So that could be quite interesting. Space age from the... Mm-hmm. Just an interesting... Just an interesting marketing kind of element. Yeah. That's been all I have to do, guys. I hope I didn't go through that too quickly. Just a real quick question. The weight of these different elements. Have you... No idea. I have no idea. I'm assuming that... The kinetic battery isn't going to take up that much weight. And the titanium is very light, I know. But it's really basic. That's all I have gotten so far. All right. Any other questions? No? Okay. Can I save this in the shared projects if anyone wants to look? Thank you, Perf. And I have considerable notes on the topic as well if anyone needs any more information. If you made notes yourself, you can put those on our... Underneath our... Oh, in your book, the No-Write. But if anyone has any specific questions, don't hesitate to email me or something. All right. I guess, okay. Okay, now we're concepts, concepts of user interface. Yeah, this one's so much tighter than the other one. I know. Nope. There we go. There you are. That happens. Can I help you? All right. So I'm going to describe the concept of the user interface list as a device. We've talked about the two essential properties of the user interface. We wanted to be simple and we wanted to be fashionable. However, we've also got to remember that this is a device that's as useful as it is. We want people to be able to use it as a remote control. So we need to determine what the essential functions of the device are. And make sure that we include... But we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people. We have a number of different choices for a design concept. And that's something that I'll show you some examples of. But essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work? How... What kind of model is that going to be the use of interaction with this device? Once we've chosen a concept for it, we can then design the features around the concepts, making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features. And of course we also have to make it look cool. So basically that's what we don't want. We don't want lots of buttons complicated features. We want something that looks nice and simple. Here's a fairly simple device. It's an iPod from Apple. I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons. It's very minimalistic in its design. It uses four buttons to move around a range of settings on a small LCD screen. The thing I like about this is that it's very quick to access the main features. You can just about make up the bottom three buttons, three of your track, next track and play calls. The main features of the iPod, the things you will use all the time. Then if you want to do anything more advanced, you go into the little menu on the LCD screen. And you use the buttons just to scroll around and find the more advanced features that you want. I think that's a good model that we could have. Here's another example. It's an interesting idea. I think it looks pretty cool. It's a novelty value. It's nice and colorful. It's nice and bright. It's also something that you can feel your way around. You can look at it, if you're watching TV in the dark or whatever you can work out which buttons. It's fun. I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often. You need a few buttons to select your favorite channels. I mean most people when they watch TV, they have 250 channels on their TV and they watch it for them at the most. So you have buttons for your favorite channel, changing the volume, which is something you do all the time when you're watching TV and the buttons to switch off in case you get bored. Other features, things like adjusting the brightness, tuning the TV, I don't know what else you do with a TV. These are all necessary functions. There's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast. So we need to find a way of including these somehow. One of the suggestions I'd make is to include them in a menu system a bit like on the iPod. So we'd either have a small LCD display on the device itself or have a menu display that comes up on your television and can be controlled through the device. I know it would allow you to access the advanced features whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often. Okay, so you'd be advocating an LCD then? I think that's one way to go, yes. The advantages and disadvantages that you, if you have an LCD display, it's nice because it lets you sit there and control your television from your armchair. There are disadvantages and an LCD display would have to be quite small because we're... I assume we're going to be making quite a small device. It would also have to have a kind of backlighting in it because you tend to watch TV in the dark and you need to be able to see your LCD display. Your alternative is to have a non-screen display on your television that you control for your remote control. A bit like how they have these digital boxes where you press buttons and it comes up with your listing of watch on each channel. That's also a good idea. It does have these problems as well if you've got a small TV and you're sitting on the other side of a room. It's hard to read the notes, it comes up. But that's a design decision that we can make. I do think that one of the important features for remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on. So favorite channels is applicable but I think that you do need to have some kind of function where you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it. I know I use that. Is that separate from what he was saying? Well, if it was an LCD on the remote, I don't know that you would be able to see it. I think we're talking menu contrast and tuning the VCR or something if I've understood you, Chris. Rather than menu as what's on. Okay, because that would be more specifically digital boxes. If we put a display on the remote control, communication is one way. So you can't have a television send information back to the remote control. How good point you can. Yeah. Okay. Now I'm moving on to market marketing. Okay. Is that guy? Maybe it's just that. What after your press five? Eight. I don't know how relevant all of this is going to be. Anything. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think I'm going to have a little bit of trend watching. Basically I was giving an executive summary that was a market investigation on road controls that was recently conducted. And then also some fashion waters and Paris and Milan commented on some things that are going to be going on this year. And right now they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference. But that really over the next year that's going to be switching to fancy look and feel remote. So that just goes back to the whole desire of our real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion. So even though we're stressing, we're talking, we've all been talking about this simplicity and easy to use idea. They're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel. And as these are ranked, the top one is doubly important to the second one, which is doubly important to the third one. So just to take that weight into account. The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovation. That would be like if we use something like the space material or LCD screen things like that. And then each of you was the third most important. So really no matter what we need to focus the most on fancy look of you according to this. I don't know what you're going to do with that. And then fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes, shoes and furniture is for to vassible. And that there's a preference for spongy type material. And so that brings us to my personal preferences. Who wants this bunch of your vote or want a different national that personally. I don't really think that I want one that's going to go out the style or go stale excuse the pun in a year. So even though this is coming from us as you know trend watch market research. I don't know how much of a read necessarily want to take away also considering that the research has been carried out by real people. I've been carried out by real reaction. I'm a little hesitant as to like how these questions may have been worded. And if necessarily this whole fashion technology to ease of use is necessarily the right ranking. Personally like I might reverse it. But if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what we have to stress fashion the most. It doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material. But there's all kinds of scope for imagination that would do. I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them that pretty much sums it up. So yeah. Could we have any some questions for this? Yeah. What can I possibly in my mind? Do you have any ideas how to possibly use these? How to use a fruit of vegetable or the spongy material at all? Like could we make a spongy remote it would be easier on the hands. If it's latexy it's kind of. Then we'd have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that I don't know. My understanding of latex cases that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside but it's covered with the latex which is spongy or softer on your hands. There's something to be said. We got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to our repetitive stress injuries. So something that's horrible. I think we don't want to go smoggy. We don't want to go smoggy. I think I'm envisioning more like the material that you have when you sit on a bicycle so it doesn't hurt. You're sitting on for a long time like I'm imagining that sort of thing. I don't know what that feels like. Given the list of materials I was forwarded it that seems doable. Could we go in vegetable colors? Or maybe like a couple main ones being like I don't know leavens or strawberries. Could they be smelly? Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable? I don't know. Oh it's quite easy to shape. Or maybe the buttons could be shaped. Like large buttons. What about the idea like a round remote instead of like a vertical up and down one? In terms of holding it. That's a sheet for a fruit. It might be tied in a little. You'd be able to hold it because I think the reason they're long is. But yeah. You heard it press push. When you use a remote you press the buttons with your thumb usually. I usually hold it one hand maybe. I maybe want something that shaped like a mobile phone. So you hold it in one hand. But then the buttons will have to be very small. I tend to do it. But you think you're just thumb size. But I mean in order to get to all of them. Yeah. They would have to be within a certain amount of space. But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway. And it's not so much. When I'm pressing buttons on my iPod that's how I do it. Hold it in press. So you hold it in one hand. And you press the buttons. Yeah. And use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel. I love the idea. Yeah. We all like iPod. The button on the iPod is it? What is it? Is it just four buttons or is it four? It's like five. Because there's one at the metal. Yeah. I mean each version of it has been a little bit different. The one I have doesn't have the four on each. Oh yeah. I don't know. I have one of the in between ones when they weren't doing that anymore. And you press the center button. That's your all-purpose select button right there. Oh, look at it. This is the one in the center that's not marked. Yeah. I think why it would be good for us is because like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping. And then the other one could be like for volume. Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things. But then how you go back to the menu. And like I don't know if we would want it on the screen there on the actual TV. I kind of am wanting to say on the TV because if you're changing the brightness, don't you want to see it happening kind of? Yeah. And I think it's all how that real world is. Yeah. I think it's all how that real world is. Yeah. It might be good in theory but not as useful in practice. It's a bit difficult in practice. Yeah. Also, yeah. Because you would be looking down at the LCD screen. Right. You'd be looking at one of the things. Okay. We have, we have about 15 minutes left. So I'm going to continue with my presentation. I have one more slide before we close. But in that slide is when we need to make decisions about these kinds of things. So I'll just bring that up and show you all. We'll move on. I think any more information on fruits and vegetables. Can we let you know? Can we have changeable covers like for your mobile? In different fruit and vegetable colors. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then like the covers could be spongy latex. Exactly. But the actual model could be tiny. And you could court day with your house or whatever. Please option. The packaging, it should be like a lemon and the packaging is like peel. So that's the thing. The box you just kind of peel it. There you go. There you go. But I've had packaging. Me, like was so, that was a cat's fun. Like the way it all comes off. Hmm. I'm actually. Okay. Um, components concept. Energy. Chip on. Oh, yes. Right. I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get. Be necessary. But um, that's, this is the agenda they gave me. So what can you just explain to them as real quick? Decisions. What the, okay, this is, this is on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery. Uh-huh. Um, I don't know what do people think about this kinetic battery idea? I think it's awesome. I think it's really cool. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I would totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries. Yeah. I think it's good as long as we consider the cost and uh, how reliable it is. Right. I haven't gotten any cost. Yeah. Any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery. But um, but over time, but if we're using a, a cheaper chip than it will even out, I think, um, circuit boards. Um, yeah. I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced. They're, they're a thin fiberglass with copper wires etched onto them. And I think they're quite easily printed on by machine, which is chip on print is whether machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us. I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions. I wasn't really given any options. I was just given that this is how they're done. Okay. Um, yeah, I can't, can't really tell you. I can, I can tell you a whole lot about how it works. But I don't know any decisions on if they're, if they're really options. Yeah. I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah. Um, okay, then we'll move on to the case. Um, I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple, a regular or an advanced chip, maybe here's the, here's the thing on the chips that I, that I got. Simple regular advanced chip on print, the chip on print includes an infrared sensor, so we don't have to worry about that. Um, okay, the push button, if we're going to have push buttons, they require a simple chip, but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and an LCD requires advanced. Do we want to scroll wheel or do we just want push buttons? Um, I don't think we need to scroll wheel. I mean, it might be nice for changing the volume. It would be nice for changing the volume, but I don't know how useful it would be for changing the channel, because you don't have control over numbers or, yeah, it'd be, it'd be handy for going through if there was an on screen menu of your channel choices. But if you could scroll through the channels, and then the volume would just be, we have five minutes left for the meeting. And the volume would just be like the same way, yeah, forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker, sort of looking. Yeah. And otherwise, no matter how many buttons we have, we're going to have like, you know, black with red sticking out and the note, it's going to inevitably sort of start looking like. That's a group of sort of ugly ones. Have you stopped up? So have a scroll for volume or for all those secret functions. When you get on the on screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons, you could have a scroll wheels to go through those menus. I think, yeah, I think a scroll wheel would be nice, but it's not necessary. So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip, depending on may we could table out this in for later. I think, well, I think when we go into the user face, we're going to have to decide the interface. We're going to have to decide whether we're going to have a scroll or not. Well, let's think about that while we talk about the case. Okay, let's do case. I'm kind of liking the idea of latex. If spongy is the end thing. I'm a little hesitant about it because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside. Okay. Well, could it be hard and then something around it? Yeah, I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing. What I've seen just not related to this, but of latex cases before is that there's a lot like a hard plastic inside and it just covered with the latex. Not too thick of a layer of latex just enough to be gripable. I like the bike handles or anything that you've seen like that the inside is hard. I don't think we need to worry about protecting this or import, I think, that that's done for us. Okay. So we do want latex. Yeah. Okay. Latex. Probably in colors, maybe fruity vegetable colors. Yeah. Fruity colors. Okay. Let's go to the user interface then. We'll come back to the chip, I suppose. Oh, and we want a curved case, yeah. Or a double curved. Well, we don't really know what the difference is, right? The thing in curved is some sort. Yeah. Okay. We don't really know what the difference is. Okay. Interface the type and the supplements. So push or scroll, right? Yeah. Or both. And I think if we want to keep our costs, we should just go for push buttons. Because then we can have a simple chip. And it's simpler. It's cheaper to make push buttons than it is a scroll button. Good point. Sometimes, in terms of the economics, it's probably better to push buttons. And if we had an on-screen kind of thing that you could scroll through, like you could use your buttons to scroll through things. Yes. I think that, for channel surfing, I think a scroll, an actual iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast. Yeah, I don't know. I say push buttons, at least unless we get any information that I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than a push button. But it's got to be some more expensive. So I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery in the cool case. Is that okay with you? Yeah. And let's see if we get anything else. I mean, I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel. It's more just to give it a different kind of luck. But if it's going to be in a latex type thing, and that's going to look cool, then that's probably going to have a bigger impact on the scroll wheel. Okay, so we're going to go with type push buttons. And then supplements. How are we going to do that? What do you mean by supplements? I assume that's what else we're going to, like, the additional buttons we can use. So we're going to have like a menu button so that we can access on-screen things. Then, okay, so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through. So what button's going to be on off? On off volume type channels. So like one through five. Like a radio type sort of situation. Yeah, like radio presets. Preset channels. And then we're going to need numbers one through zero. Right? No. No. I think maybe numbers since it's called... Well, but in order to pre-set it... Oh, you guess you can just hold it down when you get to one. When you're scrolling to... When you need some kind of... Up, down, kind of button. Yeah, up, down. Double button, but... For example. Yeah. Okay, finishing the meeting now. Our next meeting starts in 30 minutes. You each have things to do. Look and field design. User interface design, product evaluation. And you two are going to work together on a prototype using modeling clay. Okay. Supposedly instructions for our prototype. Wow. Um, did we decide on a chip? Let's go with a simple chip. Simple chip. Okay. We are done. Thank you, everyone. I'll... These are already in our shared folder. Okay. Cool. Okay. It's working out. Yeah.",
        "abstract": "The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer discussed possible materials to use in making the case for the remote, options for buttons, and options for batteries. The interface specialist presented two existing products which incorporate features the team is seeking to embed in their remote. The interface specialist also discussed other features to possibly incorporate into the design of the remote, such as an LCD screen. The marketing expert discussed recent findings from trend watching reports and how to incorporate these findings into the remote design with respect to what materials to use and the overall appearance of the product. The team then discussed other options for how they could incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the appearance of their product. The team then discussed other options for batteries, chips, buttons, and materials for the case, as well as the option to have a menu function.",
        "actions": "Two members of the team will work on creating a prototype using modeling clay. The industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design and will gather more information on curved and double-curved case options. The marketing specialist will work on product evaluation. The interface specialist will continue to work on the interface concept",
        "decisions": "The target group comprises of individuals who can afford the product. The remote will use a kinetic battery. The remote will have a latex case. The remote will be made in fruity colors. The remote will have some sort of a curved case. The remote will have pushbuttons. The remote will have a power button, volume buttons, channel preset buttons, and a menu button. The remote will have a simple chip.",
        "problems": "Having an LCD on the remote versus a menu that is viewed on the television screen. Whether to use latex or titanium for the case. How to incorporate a vegetable and fruit theme into the design of the remote. What sort of circuit board to use. Whether to use a simple, regular, or advanced chip. Whether to use a scroll wheel or pushbuttons. Whether to have a flat, curved, or double-curved case."

        "transcript": " Okay. Okay. Welcome to our detailed design meeting. I'm pretty excited. Let's start. It's approximately 1540 or something like that. Okay. The agenda, we're going to do an opening and then I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting what we did just fast. Then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria. We'll look at the finances and finally do a production evaluation and close. So starting off with the last one, I don't have it here, but we talked about energy. We're going to use a kinetic battery. We want to use a simple chip because we're not going to need a shovel. We're going to need a scroll. We're choosing a latex case in fruity colors that's curved. And we're using push buttons with a supplement of an on-screen menu. Then sounded like we had set eight or nine buttons, including five preset channels. Okay. Let's do the look and field design presentation first. One is those. Right. Well, we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with this one. We have our colors not fixed, but this is the general shape. You hold it either like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand. You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push them with your index finger with your other hand. Or even then there's a whole variety. You can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger. We have the on-off button at the tip. Very visible. Very big. We have our up and down buttons, which are also going to be our channel selectors and we have our little menu button here. If you push, if you're just pushing these normally, they're the menu buttons. If the volume buttons are either if you press select once, they become channel changing buttons. You can press select three times, the menu with the other features and possibly also with your TV channel choices shows up and you have your five presets down here. If people want to grab hold of that and see how it feels in your hand, let's our number one prototype. Do you want to present the potato or shall I peel off the varsity? I'm going to take a little lightning bolt in it. Very cute. I can pull that one. The rompus. The rompus? This one's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's really blue buttons here after adjusting the volume. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. That's basically what it was like when it's in the middle of... Onoff. That would be... One of your channels. Basically... ...stock-on channel zero, that would be... That would turn soft. That would turn soft... Could the middle button of the看 screen the pattern? That's really it would make it hearts... If you press and held it maybe, you can call it down. Yeah. That would be on. On a possibility. Okay. And then finally we have the Martian or the pair. Either way, it's a bit different. Just a little bit more of a creative feel. You have the on a toggle stem on the top. We have the five preset seats. And then you have all the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional. You have your channel changing volume changing buttons on your menu button right here in the middle. So, perhaps for your consideration as well. Plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up. We figured it could stand up like this on your table if you wanted it to if I made the bottom flat. Sorry, what's the yellow one in the middle? The menu select button. Very interesting. That's my favorite. That's our three kinds of items. Basically, in terms of what the game is, first of all, decide on a form which of the three different types do you want. Very, this type of button there, we want a number of buttons. And then it's a piece of what kind of experience it is. We were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colors, but maybe we're also thinking that you're sort of middle-aged man, for an example, customer, might not want a fruity colored remote. So, maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down, maybe with less contrast on it. If something's still a little bright to make it hard to lose, but... Yes. Now that was one thing that we wrote up over email, I don't know if you picked up your email, but the feature that we considered for it not getting lost. Right. Well, we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email. And we think that each of these are so distinctive, that it's not just like another of these up technology around your house, it's going to be somewhere that it can be seen. So, we're not thinking that it's going to be as critical to our covers or in a couch. It's so sad. Would it be very difficult to just have an external device that taped to your TV that when you press it, a little beep goes off, do you think that would be conceptually possible? I think. Because it feels a nice mouse. It's probably under the safety, and then that has a non-seminant, but that's something that's really good. That's true. I wonder if it's the biggest thing that the thing is, I don't know how many times people have been in service in doing that to go with the device like that. There might be something that you can do in the short of word in the chip to make it make a noise or something, but it would take a lot more development than we have this after. Okay. That's a fair evaluation. Getting lost. We decided not to worry about that for now. Okay, because, well, the designs are very bright, so you're right, they're going to stick out. So, do people have a preference as far as feeling functionality? I feel like this is similar to sort of what already exists, so we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun, even though this is like what you're initially drawn to, just because it's comfortable and not different. I sort of like this one. I don't know why. It's small, but still sort of cute looking. I don't know. But I also like the side buttons on that one. I think that's kind of neat. But I don't know how much any of this has to do with the fashionable, sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on. Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for Anos, so then we would have to do a one for the next one. There we go. That's good. Here. Stick it on. Sure. Why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria, if you want to? Well, to be blunt, I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for. Okay. That was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do. But let me, I have to write something on the whiteboard. Do you need this or just write on the whiteboard? No, I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing. Okay. Because I think it would be redundant. Okay. Oh. It's kind of like a joystick kind of thing. Yeah. Hey. Okay. Maybe a little smaller than that. No, I kind of like it. That's hard to miss. Oh, it does. It's kind of like. It's kind of like. Oh, come. There. It could have a stem like that. Because I do kind of like the stem. Yeah. It almost helps you keep a grip too. Because it goes in between things. Just a thing. I like this one. Okay. Is that what we're doing? We're doing the potato. I like the idea of a bird. I mean, that's really gotten. The simplicity of the buttons down that one. I am worried about like using a menu. It's not like within menus there are sub menus. And so how do you get back to the main menu? Well, on the island, you just, every time you want to go back, you hit the menu button. You're going to get back to the main menu. That is a menu button separate from a select button. Whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button. Okay. You can find the choice if you want to see if this is the right button. Could these be used for going sub menus? Maybe it could be one of those if you press down and hold for two seconds. Then it brings you back one level or something. Okay. Well, as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it. Okay. Okay. So which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our necessities? The yellow we want is that potato? Are we leaning towards the potato? Okay. Well, we can obviously change it after we go through these different ones. So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before. We need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to. So what we sort of want to do is we each need to separately rank each of the following things. And then I'll tabulate in average just to make sure that it doesn't meet that. So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true. And seven being not true at all or false. If the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria. So we can do this one first. First you want to know if it meets the fancy look and feel objective. So like in my opinion, for now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle. So I'm going to say it's like a three. That's just my opinion. Yeah. What is each of you? I kind of think it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or two. Okay. Well, give it the number. Okay. I will give it a one. I don't know if it's creative. I don't know if fancy is the word I would use. I don't know if any of them are fancy. I'd say two because it's a unique. And two. Awesome. All right. And same sort of scale for functionality. Is it functional? I think it's extremely functional. I'm going to give it a one. One. I think it's functional. It's also very pricey. It's under the same. Okay. Functional. I think it'll get everything done. I think it might be a little confusing at first. Well, there's some other responses that we'll address that. Okay. Then I'm going to give it a two. Awesome. Okay. We want to know next if it's technologically innovative. Did you give it functional? Yeah. She said it. Is it technologically innovative? Not really. I mean, not so much because we don't have the LCD screen. We don't have fancy chip. Other than what it looks like, I don't know if it's really... It's a really baddery. It's a really baddery. It's a genetic battery's big one. So... How many people have noticed that though? But we know it's there. And you're going to be like, hey, I have never changed the battery. And if it's made of latex, that whole idea, that's pretty cool. I'll give it a three. Because it... I could have picked a lot of features. I would made it really. Yeah. I would say that it's... Yeah. Like fancy versus creative. It's... It's different. Which is that, you put innovative, I don't know. I'll give it a three. Why? You don't know? It's a terminological. It's not... It's not unique. It's just... It's just... It's just... It's just... It's just... It's just... It's... It's... I could have picked it. I think I'm going to go with four as well. Okay. I really like that. I can have that right now. Next, is it easy to use? Just so you know, easy to learn will be separate. Is it all? Okay. I think it's really easy to use. I'll give it... Not too. I'll give it a one. Pretty hard to mess up. What's the one? I'll say two. All right. We next want to see if it has a spongy quality. And if indeed it's made of latex or rubber. It's spongy all the way. Give it a one. Yeah. I wonder if it bounces when you drop it. Ooh, then you could... It'd be hard to break, hard to lose. Yeah. It'd be less impact. And what do you give it? I'll give it a one. All right. And the next is... Does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables? Well, is it going to be yellow? It might be... Who that's our corporate color is this? That's right. Yeah, corporate color. We didn't keep that in. We might not keep it yellow. Well, if we... I know it would make it a little less... A little more confusing, but if we had all the buttons in black and the design and the outside and yellow, That would be our corporate one. And then we could also have alternative colors. One and more conservative one. Yeah, it's more like a silvery kind of white or something. Yeah. Um, and can we have like an RR inscribed on the bottom or something? Sure. Okay. All right. So I think it's... It was inspired by the potato. Yeah. I think it's kind of mango-y too. Yeah. Oh, man. Okay, I'll give it a one. The mango kind of put me over. That's so much more fun to do. What's everyone's number? One. Oh, it's it. One. All right. And does the design match the appropriate behavior? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use the channel flipping in the volume the most. I think we really took that into account a lot. So I'm going to give it a one. Yeah. Me too. Do you say one, Rose? Yes. Okay. I'm also... We talked earlier about RSI and wanting to prevent any sort of like carpal tunneling kind of thing. Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account? I think I'll give it a two because I almost feel like no matter what you do, something is going to happen. And if it's repetitive movement, it is going to be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing. But I'm worth the rest of my time. I like how it fits in the hand though. I'd go with the two. I'll say two as well because older people that aren't used to like texting, but if I might run a bit, you cry at first. You'll pause it too. All right, awesome. And the ease of learning it. I know you were saying that you were a little bit nervous about that. I don't know. It's sort of a reminding of the iPod. I just got my NICELM at Reddy Instruction Book and I'm doing okay. And I'm not good at learning technology. So I'll give it a two. The menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing. But I think if it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out, but you'll have it afterwards. So I think I'd give it a two, I guess. I think it's a problem that a lot of the master mates do because you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what you've done over. Oh, good point. I think that I've learned it fast. Once you've learned how to use it, I think that you want to give it a four. Okay. I think I'd give it a four too. It's a pretty high learning curve. It'll be easy once you've done it. All right. Also earlier, we had something about losing it. And so now we're not addressing that at all. So we, I think we can kind of say we addressed it with color. Okay. So in terms of not losing it, do you think that on a scale of one to seven, how easy or hard is it to lose? I'm going to give it a four because I think that you can still, in between summer where you can't see it, you're kind of not going to find it. But anywhere else it's going to stand out. I did give it a three. This depends how tidy you are normally. You're give it a four. It's small too. Okay. We also said simplicity. How, how well does it address just being simple? Simple to use or simple on design. I think overall, because we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion. So those are the next few things we're going to look at. Separate from fancy, like that sort of thing. It like wants to be simple, but it's not like totally, totally simple. So I'm going to give it a two. I want to give it a three, I guess. Three. All right. And fashionable. It's totally fashionable. It's hot. I mean, it's a mango. Mom. I mean, how fashionable can you make a road? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together really well. I don't know. I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot or both. I do like the little animation. The toggle on off switch. It's really appealing. Number two. One. And does it meet our demographic need for international appeal? That whole thing. I just said it would serve our audience. I don't see why not. I think as long if we offer in at least three different color arrangements. Yeah. That's good. So I'll give it a two. Yeah. All right. Does anyone have any other features that they think are important that we didn't talk about? Well, we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to have a corporate logo. So let's make sure we keep that in mind that we have that one of our color concepts is corporate and has an RR on it. Well, I think all of us are. And so we're going to do that. So it will address it. Fine. Okay. Now we're going to look at finances. I have an Excel sheet that we're actually going to calculate the costs. So let me add it out of this first. Okay. All right. I know. Okay. Hand dynamo. We're using a kinetic battery, right? We're using a kinetic, yeah. And we're having one per one. Okay. Electronics. Single. Simple. Simple rather. Okay. Case. A double curved. Yeah, that's very curvy. Okay. Yeah, I don't have to get a picture of it. So I don't really know. Our case material supplements. Oops, we just skipped one. We don't need plastic. And no, we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed. But this supplement is the one. I guess it was rubber. It was rubber and special color. Yeah. Three. More than one special color. Yeah, we're using. We're going to need at least two special colors. I don't know what the basic color is. Yeah. Well, but we know that we're having at least three colors. Well, are we talking about on each color combination? Or we know that we'll have yellow and black. Is that two special colors? I don't know. Or is white and black being used more? Or. I guess this is three. You're saying three, three, three? You're right. Maybe the RR will be in color as well. So, yeah. Interface. We're doing push buttons. Yep. And how many buttons do we have? Six. On a five. With a power. Anything else? No. Oh, we don't. Do we want. Or the button in special color special. I didn't get information on. Oh, wait. Oh, buttons. Oh, so. So the case material will just have one color, right? Well, it's. But if we're making multiple varieties of. This is where I'm getting confused. We're saying per unit. Per unit. Okay. So each unit will only have one color. And each. But the cases. Could have up to three. I mean, the buttons could be up to three colors. That's how it's designed there. I like it like that. Okay. Special form. They're all kind of just push button. No, I think they're fine. Special material. We want them rubber as well. Probably, yeah. So. Oh, do I have to do it per button? Do I? No, I don't think so. I think they're all going to be rubber. Is that what it matters? Yeah, because for the whole case material, it's only one. Yeah. I mean, it's two to make it rubber. Okay. Oh, wait. So maybe. 13.7. Uh-oh. Yeah. What can we reduce? Okay, let's have our buttons. I'll be one color. I kind of like the about that would do. It's only going to bring us down to 13.3 anyway. All right. Okay. Are we sure this is double curved? Maybe it's single curved. We have to know idea. Yeah. We have to know idea. I don't know. I didn't get any pictures. Single curved. Why? Well, it's not. Yeah. Okay. It's a kinetic battery that's kind of expensive. But we have a simple chip. Single curve. Case material is rubber and it's a special color. Yeah. But that's important. That is important. Six buttons. How do we get more to have six buttons? What's in you just changed? It was 13 and no it's 15. No, okay. Maybe not. I don't know what just happened. Now it's 12. Oh. 12.5. Hey. So we're okay. I think that. Yeah. Yeah. Ish. Okay. We're all set. Um. Okay. I'm going to have to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. Um. Say. I say that to our big shuttered boulder. So you know. Um. Okay. Back to Agenda. Um. Are the costs under $1250? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, we are. Let's move on to the project evaluation. Project process. So it's just a fraction of, for example, the room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, the means. And you know, ideas found. So I guess what we're going to talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project, the information we got, and used how we used it. If we were able to, you know, use our creativity with the information. Um. How, how well I guess I let it. Um. The, how well we worked together as a team. Um. The digital pen, the whiteboard. Okay. I felt very creative. I enjoyed making the prototype. I think it would have been successful in that, um, to almost all of the other models for the set of samples. Yeah. I think we could have done even better with a little bit more information, like once a single curve case, how many colors, what do colors count? Uh-huh. Things. But given, given what we had, I think we did, we did really well. Um, I think we worked together pretty well. Yeah. I mean, if I had had more market research, other than the fruits and vegetables, maybe we could have taken that into account. But the fruit is the most stimulated by creativity. I know. I really did. The whole mango idea was crazy. No. I mean, do you think that the pen was a little distracting from what we did? It was a little distracting for me personally. Like, it's heaviness. Like, just being so conscious of turning the pages, I don't know. That was a bit of a distraction. But with the last one, like, I chose not to do a PowerPoint, because I think it made sense to hear, so I like that I had the option to do that. And just to take my own notes and all sorts of things. I think we all made very significant contributions. I don't think anybody dominated it, which I thought was really good. Like, each of us was able to, like, did you have your information? And I tried to facilitate it without, like, taking it over. Yeah. Come in little finished bottles. I think that's funny. You can't. Kind of want one. Can we work at this as the back-go-round? Should we have that somewhere on the packaging? I have a little. Trying to think of a good pun that I could add there, but I know it's like a legit gil. Like the RR, that's going to be etched in. Yes. Hopefully not with just my thinking at one point. But I'm going to use for a little gadget. Oh, thanks to Ian for the design of that one. He's on. Okay. What do we find? New ideas. New ideas. People should really base their own votes on to its eventually votes. Definitely. Or at least be creative enough to think of toggle switches. I, et cetera. I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now. Oh, I'm still excited about them. Can anyone know they existed? I knew you could get watches that had them, like, really quite expensive watches. That just never needed a battery because you're always moving your wrist. But in other things, I think it would be really good. And it, yeah. That's all. Okay, closing. I have to cost you the budget with the project evaluated. And then to find a questionnaire meeting summary. So this is a great product, kids. I think we've created something really interesting and then we have a market for it. Especially if we can produce it at 12.3, which we hope. Make sure your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the final results. Yeah, I do like the Martian remote. If we could choose more than one, that would be my second choice. Oh, that would definitely be my second choice. Although the twat toggle. I'm afraid I would break it. I would break it. I think I would break it. It started because I wanted to have it as a stem. All right. So that's funny. It started as a pair, but then it started looking word-worldly. I'm looking like a penguin. I'm like, oh yeah, we're doing your research. I like that it stands on. Well, maybe I should market it to some remote control company. So our art. Oh, that's awesome. A little thing. Okay. Congratulations. Um... What did you say? Nothing will come up until after our meeting. It's supposed to be over at five. I mean, I've got more master classes. Anybody else want to take a master's class? That's really funny that you got spam in your work. Yeah. But check it out. So like, there are all these links that are going. But all you need to keep in mind your knowledge management. I just want to make sure you do. No, the first time I used something like I didn't realize it was a joke. And I was like, why did she send me that? It's very work relevant. Because people spam a lot. Yeah, definitely. I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website. Here, you can see what the real... You can see the corporate website. You can just see what's on. It's paracet about a ticket for it. Wow. Yeah. It's really deep. Oh, man. It takes a little while. I'm getting excited to load. That thing, the Excel thing is pretty cool. That's how I live Excel. It's one of my favorite programs. It's like inspiration. Basically, I'm going to give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing. You miss out that much. Yeah, my inspiration from last time is the interior of remote control being taken apart by a bit. Talking about circuit ports. I learned a lot actually. I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to. That's almost cool. I got a whole table and everything. I don't have all of those circuits and chips and trans ponders. I wrote it all down because I thought it would be relevant. All the different parts of the inside of a remote control. But then they're like, you don't actually need this. It's like my name was like, would you prefer an LCD screen or multifunction remote control than I didn't have any kind of table? It's awesome. I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report there as well. It's really interesting though. I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of that. Otherwise the technology out today was kind of cool. That was really how it got. Emails. It was a lot of fault. No. Although I don't see how we could have very a lot, at least for me. If I had gotten pictures of the different parts of the case, the different looks of the case, I would have probably drawn them up. Because they weren't voting on anything. I think usually, like, great boards are good. You're crossing ideas or like, if we had a brainstorming period. They would have put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it. That's how you're good. For the only four people, it doesn't really make sense. I had with the PowerPoint that we can all look at. You can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint. And these might have made us more willing to take notes than to write them up here. Because we all needed them separately, kind of in the whiteboards in this room. Because we were all going to be working in different places. If we were all going to stay here all the time, then having the notes up on the whiteboard would have been all right. But everyone needs their own specific notes. Now, when you were creating your prototypes here, did you work together or did you do separate projects? We worked together, but we were like, like, some sort of like different projects. And then we discussed how the body was going to work. Mm-hmm. So, how did you find the key and the key? It was a bit of both, really. We just kind of started out by each taking a color of clay and just pulling around with it. And I came out with that rhombus shape. And he came out with a sort of potato-y mango-y shape. And then, just went from there, really. Cool. That was fun. So, well done with the management. I felt well-managed. Oh, thank you. I think we could well and say that we're just keeping our patience to time. And certainly, actually, we did the good job of making fun decisions. Mm-hmm. Sorry. That happened to be all the time though. I know what happened sometimes is that events have been happening to me. And then, because it took the way without anything that really gave the decided. Mm-hmm. I think, and we got the decisive points now that we can set up the new ways that I want to make it. Yeah, I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting. We didn't really have enough information to make from decisions. Mm-hmm. But we were able to do it regardless, so. I'm not usually a very decisive person, so it helped to help people say this needs to be done to find them. I found that we could have used another five or ten minutes. Especially the last time. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think the last time we had a lot of information, but at the same time, not quite enough. You know what I mean? We couldn't answer every single question. Right. But, and I felt the first two meetings that I was coming in with no information. And that sort of made me really, I don't know, throwing together a PowerPoint out of no information there. And the last time it was like the opposite, I had so much information and so much to talk about. It was interesting what came out later, like as I was doing the, when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me, that more points came out from your presentation even. I'm a little, I am a little disappointed that we didn't do something for losing their amount, because that was kind of a big point. But that was something like in order to talk about that, we would have had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards. That was like, even when we just were creating from the Excel file, there wasn't like an option to select to somehow have it included. So there was no way we could be like, yeah, I haven't included. There's no way for us to have ridden down that it was really there. I think we were just getting over in through the essay with the task. Well, it's interesting really got into it. I mean, I got into it as the day went on. I got really like, oh, I'm designing room of control. I don't know if that's just me, but yeah, it was really. It was interesting though that they put that 50% of people say they have frustration with losing their amount, and yet they didn't provide us with information too. Yeah, I'm trying to discuss that. I know that people have things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep. But I'm sure that would require some kind of technology that I just don't know what it is. I think there are some of those like, intercom or show remote that have things so you won't lose them. I don't know. I mean, we were talking about it in like, in my household at least, there's only about two places that their remote is ever. There's only one TV and there's only like, you never got a place where your keys are. I always do anyway. You'll lose them in your pocket. Like, you just won't forget that, or you'll like put it down somewhere that like made sense. And then, I remember there's always ways to lose things. Yeah, it depends on how organized you are personally. Yeah, or like, I guess what the set of the house is to. But I am notorious for losing my keys. I guess I've just never lost the remote. I put my keys in the refrigerator the other day. But I was putting groceries away. You're taking stuff on the bag and putting them in the refrigerator. In fact, my room can't get in. Yeah, it can. Look all around the kitchen. Definitely in the vegetable drawer. So I always do the alleviate in my coat and like, you as you need a different coat. Yep. I guess it's good we don't really care about it around that much. I can't wait to get into the other room. Maybe it was our little robot when we could have had him have a robot alien pair or whatever he is. Have a little voice. I am located. A GPS. It's an intergal GPS. And then, yeah. I thought if it's sitting still for a minute. We should make one that walks by itself. It really could get up and walk away. Or like some crazy like electro magnet that you push it in your little zoom to the TV and stick there. Or just a wheel, you know. Just if you have to ever vote for your robot. Well, but if you could attach them to the TV. I'll kind of press the button. Okay. Sorry, I'm just trying to update my minutes. I decided to, you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint in minutes will be complimentary. Yeah. Rather than like repeating, I'm just going to make a make full minutes so that it will include all of the agenda. Wow. Because it seems a little more useful. You can't look the most typing and organizing to do. But I didn't have like information to sloth the area there. How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you? Every meeting. Most of it. I added slides. I added a couple of slides each time, but that was about it. I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in. I didn't even think about adding more. Well, the thing was you would provide you an agenda with several points, but it wouldn't have a slide for each point. And that's the only way I remember that I need to go over that point. I know personally when I do PowerPoint, that's what I do. I added ones. Even if it was just like the title of it, like the three presentations. That we didn't write. I'm not going to write it. You have to have a slogan on it. Or can it just be like the slogan on it? No, definitely. It could go around the other side. No, I don't think we need to. Which is art. Especially the yellow and black one. Is it yellow or blue? Or yellow and blue? Let me go to the webpage. Yeah, it's just kind of going by the webpage because they didn't give me any clear. Like yellow, red, gray. It's not going to be this black. Gray. Great. Better than black doesn't look so bumbly to you. I really understand the red and I'm like news clubbing. Finish meeting now. Wasn't it interesting that... I thought it was interesting that our marketing expert did not agree with the marketing choices. I walked through thinking you were doing a really big market evaluation. You wouldn't just have one set of sources. They were so not backed up. It would just be a sentence to be like, we did a survey. This is what people said. Yeah. I don't know. People are stupid. I guess it's sort of like gray isn't it? Yellow and gray but then the slogans and blue. Well, we got some gray and we got some blue buttons. We're good. Yeah. Well, they don't have the right color clay anyway. Maybe it's like... Well, we're not sadly going to actually be producing this. Oh. If they ever come out with potato. Potato bag of a shaper votes. I'm going to have to clean it in intellectual property. Yeah. I can't believe the whole day is done. I don't feel like it's been that long. It's like day.",
        "abstract": "The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape. The team felt it was not necessary to include a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost as the prototype designs were quite bright. The team conducted a product evaluation of the prototype the team liked the most. They rated the prototype on the basis of its appearance, functionality, technological innovativeness, sponginess, usability, learn-ability, its ability to be found when misplaced, simplicity, and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. The project manager then led the team in a project evaluation in which the team evaluated how they created the project, the information they found and used, their creativity, their teamwork, and the materials they had at their disposal. The team was generally quite satisfied. After the project manager's closing, the team discussed their personal preferences in terms of the prototypes. They also further evaluated the project process and discussed what they had learned.",

        "decisions": "The remote will resemble the potato prototype. There will be no feature to help find the remote when it is misplaced; instead the remote will be in a bright color to address this issue. The corporate logo will be on the remote. One of the color concepts for the remote will contain the corporate colors. The remote will have six buttons. The buttons will all be one color. The case will be single curve. The case will be made of rubber. The case will have a special color.",

        "transcript": " I think I should probably try to sit up straight. Like that? Okay, cool. Okay? Okay? I think my phone is still there as well. Like this? It's going to be hard to drink. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right. So I'm just going to start this PowerPoint real quick. Yeah. Powerpoint. Very official. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I kind of like this. Kind of getting into it. Right. So just to kick off the meeting basically. So we're working now for a real reality. This is, oh, so, right. It's just got an agenda to set out what we're going to try to accomplish in this particular first meeting. We're going to just do a quick opening. And we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another. Then we're going to start to talk a little bit about tool training. Essentially, that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet. The whiteboard. We've got a general plan for the project. How we're going to go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion and close up. IRL, you guys, you know, gamers lying in real life. So yeah, basically, I want to, I'm just going to, you got, of course, we can discuss that. I'm thinking about proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask, don't tell. So if you say something about marketing, right, sort of. I'm just going to believe that you can have a couple of them there. Exactly. I mean, if you guys, at the same time, if you, like logically, if something doesn't, like I'm like, we're going to sell remote control that's the size of this paper book, you know. You're just like, well, that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X. Obviously, go with it. I'm going to discuss it, but I'm not going to ask. Do you know that? Or it seems like. Correct. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So because we're sort of role-playing, you're going to tap into your own knowledge as well. And that's the same for you when we do introductions. I mean, and you talk about your background, you know, have fun. You know, maybe you went to, you know, maybe you're like me and you went to UCSB, but you want to say you went to Harvard or something like that. Why not? You know, you can, this is, you know, I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it. So are you guys okay with that? Does that seem logical? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it's fun. It's your book for me. It's sweet. Cool. So I guess we're totally, we're making a remote control, which is thrilling. But the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate motto. I don't know if you guys had time to check the, in real life, I don't know if you guys would have checked the, the corporate website. We've got to make something as fashionable as possible. That's kind of the corporate strategies. We're going to try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice. You know, like John Lewis Knyser, you know, if you go to DevonM's or something. So basically we are reinventing the wheel, but we want to try to do it in a user friendly slick, sleek kind of way. What we're going to go about doing that is basically at first we're going to start on the basics. And that's where I'm going to need you guys to use your interface designers and the other designer that I can't remember the, the ID and the UID. Right. The industrial designer, hey, you can do it to guide me and guide us on this project because you're going to be, you're going to be, you guys with the bottom, you know, you're like, no, you can't do that. You can't have, you know, X and Y at the same time. And then we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good, you know, like, I think you guys probably got the same email as I did, but the idea of, yes, a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee. But it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that if you touch it, you hurt your hand or something like that. And so we'll work up from there and then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage. You know what you guys build or tell me to tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can hope for and what way to go, take the basics and make it nicer. And then obviously the UID and the ID, you know, you can keep on, you know, cutting edge of how to get about maximizing what is possible to try to sink it all up. So that's a detailed design. So it's a three stage kind of thing. Right. So for now, just for the whiteboard, basically just to get used to it, I haven't tried it yet either. I'm just going to start and carry like five remote around. And just write down, I'm just going to write down one of the names of my desert disks. If you were trapped on a desert island and you can only bring five CDs along with you, name one of them that you could not all five. If you want to write all five, go for it, but name one of them that you could. Oh, we skipped introductions. Nice. I'm an excellent project manager. I'm Marty. I went to uni at UC Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a PhD in psychology. Yeah. So. I'm Sarah. I went to Michigan and I'm here to cultural studies and I'm marketing manager or something marketing expert. Don't play yourself down. I'm expert. I'm Ron. I once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the user interface designer. I'm Nathan. I'm from California and I'm here doing a master screen social college. Where'd you go to get in here? You see. I've been in my little brother goes there. Okay. Right. So desert island disks. So we have to wait for you to write it down. Are you going to tell us? Well, no, no, I'm just going to write a couple of them down. See, I'm a big music fan. I don't know if you guys are. I'm assuming everybody likes music. It's some lesser, greater extent, but there's some other options. If you're a TV slut like I am like small bill terrible television show, but I happen to love it. It's rubbish, but I love it. I went to high school with Tom willing, actually. The main thing. The guy. Wow. Yeah. Is he a wanker? Yeah. Very much so. He's a really tall. He's got to be like six six. He's a big guy. Okay, so I really like Jeff Buckley. You guys are Jeff Buckley. That's cool because like not very many people have. And oh well, I'm at his will throw a British person in there. You can't go wrong with radio. Okay, so it really works just like a panel and it makes noises I think. It's kind of weird. Anyway, yeah, yeah, you like pressing those. You'll see. Alright, so whoever wants to get up next, you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want. I guess I'll go next. Right on. Okay, we lose all my mics plugged in here. Okay. This is basically just pen practice, huh? Okay. Oh, you're much taller than me. So I'm going to write down here. Right now, I'm listening to a lot of somebody knows ever heard of Chris Bathgate, local Michigan folk singer. Nice. Really lame. And what else can I bring with me? Probably classical to Tony Leakey. Yeah, I think. And my family guy DVDs. Well, yeah, we don't need to write that one down. Oh, family guy. Do you watch the new season? No. Are you getting it online or is it? I think I'm going to start downloading it. Yeah, that'd be nice. Alright. I'm just going to put down one CD. Okay. Anybody? How do you know? Afrobeat orchestra. Very cool. Afrobeat orchestra. Yeah, very cool. It's like 15 members from Brooklyn. And I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium. That's awesome. Thanks, I think. Yeah, it's supposed to be. I'm excited. I think I love about Enra. I didn't read those. I should admit that. That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for. They're designed specifically to ignore. It's the five by five. I can't read that much. Ah, yes. That's okay. Vomit. Yes. Street pizza. That's so brilliant. Yeah. It's so horrible. I've seen more urine in this city than ever before. Seriously. But I just came from Glasgow and I'm happy to say that there's more. There's a same quantity of approximately. It's so mean. It really is. Oh. Does, uh, yeah. Ready? All right. Yeah. Mingen. Nice. Yeah. I'm going there. You're in the middle. You're in the middle. Yeah. You're going local. I have to be here for three years. I'm going to look at the terminology. I've already got more than I can keep track of. I'm going to be like, oh my god. You're turning into one of those people. Have you been home yet? No. They'll be like, say something British and you're like, oh, shut up. Hey, you're home. Oh, it should be interesting. We can tell I tell them I'm not going back. You're going to love that one. You're going to stay here. Probably. Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide. Is that religion? Yeah. Some music I grew up listening to. Yeah, yeah. And. Now I can think of somebody other one. Well, yeah, that's why. That's how it works. Yeah. Something I miss about my hometown. I miss coffee. Burritos. Burritos. Oh. And cost less than two bucks. Oh, yeah. Two bucks. And things that are like. Where are you from in California, by the way? I grew up in San Diego. But yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm from San Diego as well. Yeah. But really. I last lived in San Francisco. I haven't lived in California. Well, I haven't lived in something California since I was 18. I've lived in San Diego. I've lived in San Diego. I've lived in San Diego. I've lived in San Diego. For when? It's not like. I'm sorry. You just can't get a bit of freedom than what's available in San Diego. It's different. Because in San Diego, the tortillas are cooked on the grill. They're the California steaming them. It must make all the difference. Yeah, really does. Well, it's, it's, there's other things too. There's, you just can't place it. Like, when I went to school in Santa Barbara, which is central California, the Mexican food is okay. It's just not good. Like, yeah. It's like two bucks. like literally two bucks for this mask. I miss. Yeah. Good call on that. Where are you from in San Diego? Just literally just metropolitan San Diego. I live like five minutes from the zoo. Okay. So North Park, actually, if you want to get real space. Yeah, my grandparents lived on a 30 second. Yep. Close to you know, we're at Clare de Linde coffee shops. Yes. On University. Yeah. Yeah, it's actually like literally half a mile from my house. Cool. Yeah, pretty cool. Small world. That's a great thing before, especially when we're off from the same general region. Right. So okay, success on the whiteboard. Yeah. You can harness the awesome power. A little bit of introductions. We talked about some of our CDs and things we like about the city. I think we'll. Right. So moving on to not fun stuff. Project finance. Basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for 25 euros. This is what the finance department has told me, the CFO, but I don't know. I'm not sold on this. It's pretty dear. I mean, 20th, that's like, you know, 40 bucks for a remote. It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me. So we can maybe work on that later, but we're going to make a lot on it. The profit aims to make 50 million euros on it. You're internationally. So one of the things I was going to mention to you, you guys, the designers is that we probably need to remember. It needs to be a universal remote control probably. Okay. So something that could do NTSC as well as PAL as well as various other formats. I think it's going to control DVDs, but you know, I'll leave that to you guys, but that's something that is going to be an international sold thing. But we want to try to make it for 1250. So we want to try to make 100% profit on it if we can. Right. So just to close up, I'm not sure how much time I've used it next time. Project manager sort of is. Because I will meet another half an hour or so. And I'd like the industrial designer to get, think about what needs to be done, like what the basic function of it. UID, well, yeah, your assignments are up there and you'll also get assignments from in your email as well, more specific on what to do. Basically, I need you to tell us what we, what the user is going to want. So actually in a way, you guys, maybe in our next meeting, chat a bit about what the user is going to want and what the user can have. You know, like, you go and shape that. Yeah, well, it is. And we'll discuss the trade offs in between. And so, yeah, specific instructions will be sent in your email. But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now. And there's more things come up. We'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth. Any questions before we get started? I assume that we're building a standalone remote control. We can't kind of build it into other products. You mean to like, for instance, like a mobile phone? It's interesting. Yeah. I don't think there's any rules about it yet. Maybe our personal coach. Yeah. Or, you know, can we produce, can we sell a remote control phone for 25 pounds or less? Well, I have a think about it. I mean, I'm certainly open. It seems like, yeah, it seems like it's certainly doable, isn't it? I mean, or if we can't have a full mobile phone, maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function, the clap. No, I mean, no, good idea. Good idea. Let's see. Every remote with changeable faces like face-leafed by fast. I like that. I like that. I like that. Hot. Yeah. That's true. I guess we probably have some time. Maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we want to do. Go back to where they have it. Let me bring up something about our basic goals here, what we want to accomplish. Project announcements. Yeah. Not so much. All right, we'll find that we're on our own. Now, are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all? Yeah, yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. Same way, have any initial ideas. I'm going to go ahead and take notes on this too, because... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's pretty much given. It's going to be universal, where you'll get it excited about it, already, and it may be functioning for other things. As soon as you said that, it was going to be like all the other things you get emotes to, like your microwave or your front door, like to have everything on one thing. But then never going to fanned those huge remotes that have like a million buttons you can't tell what they do. or is better? Yeah. I'm thinking specific. I'm thinking kind of pda design, so touch screen design rather than button. I hope so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things. Yeah that slick isn't it. I mean like stylus. Yeah. Yeah. So we got five minutes more to chat about. That's perfect. So we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between size and functionality. We also multi-functional but at the same time if you do too much you're not going to be able to tell them apart. It's going to be too complicated. It's a crowded button. I'm also going to note for future reference this idea. So you like to remember I can help like a touch screen type of remote. I don't think one of these needs one outstanding feature instead of apart from all the other units. Yeah all the other universal amounts. I don't know if there's such thing out there. I guess we'll do some research on it or one of us can do some research on it about whether or not there are multi-format like you know PAL and PSC region one. I'm pretty sure there is. I mean I have a friend who has a pda that he just points at any television he wants and it'll figure out the specifications of it and we'll control it. Interesting. I assume that that can be done with around the world. Okay. All right so I'm liking that idea. This idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features. Let's see. I think making it out of a nice material would be very important because so many of those remote states that you see these universal remote looks so cheap and low quality. Yeah it's even nice and slick would be important and I don't know like there's such a problem with losing them. That adding this whole like pda pen business is only one more thing to lose so we're going to be careful of what like just something like keep in mind and we start actually deal with this stuff but that would be really cool. Let's see. I like the idea of the multi-plate. Yeah yeah. What do they call those faceplate paint? They're name-able face plates. Are they? I don't know. I like it. We'll have to come up in. Yeah. We should come up with a fuzzy one as well. I think it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a located device. Maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote. But if we're bundling it in less for selling their tele with the remote. Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it. You're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either. Well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying. Could we not do something where like just a little literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you can place somewhere else that you press and it makes the remote page. Kind of like how on a lot of cordless regular phones you have a page button. Could we do something like that? That's cool. I think so. I think we could design that. Yeah. Good. Yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of Apple has been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or the sleek kind of. And titanium and the new silver sleek ones with lots of the years. Yeah. Very much so. Curves. We do have the minimum amount. I mean we were talking finances that are not selling a 40 pound remote. Our $40 remote, 25 year remote would be pretty expensive. So maybe we might want to trade off some of the features for a lower price without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargains for universal remote that's black and you know massive some kind of I don't know a balance there in somewhere. Definitely. But um have a think about what we can do have a think about what we want to do how we're going to sell it. And our users in mind like these grandlays are not going to be into this whole new let's design it. No it's the use of the buttons. I lost to be careful of exactly what marketing is to and who we're going to be able to get it out of. It's true. I'm talking 25 pound through 25 years. 25 years. It's late. I guess. Yeah. They're all weaker than they're all stronger than the dollar. Although computer parts. Oh if you're going to upgrade your computer by it in the States. Like um do you guys know fries? Huge computer uh electronic store. These serve um are they say they will sell things overseas. So you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like 23 pounds like that. Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now. I'm going to put these initial ideas that we've got in the project documents. So if you guys need a reminder about what we've talked about on the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got in the other ideas you can consult them at your leisure. And uh right so thanks for that. Let's just head back to work on what we were talking about uh go ahead get going too. You have an hour? Yes. Okay perfect. Thanks guys. Cool. Thank you. Right.",

        "transcript": " I'll set. Okay, cool. Right, so basically I'm just going to go over real quickly some news I just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control and then I'm going to turn it over to you guys to make brief presentations on what you found and then we'll have a bit of discussion. So basically I've just found out from the board on if you guys got the email as well but it needs to be television only. So we're not doing DVD, we're not doing anything else, it's just going to be a television remote. It also needs to have the company colors included in it. So that's red and black and it has to have the slogan. In case you guys forget the slogan it's we put fashion and electronics and no teletext. I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do so we don't want to include that in this particular design for reasons that I don't really know this but it's the board so there you go. So basically given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean because it's television only we will be able to change our well we can sacrifice more function for a better television remote. So I'm going to turn it over to the industrial designer to go ahead and make a presentation. So do I unplug you in this bit here? Yep. It's going to come up. Okay. Right. That's page one of my presentation. So the method we're going to have to understand how remote controls work and we're going to say successfully complete this project. Remote control works as follows. It's all pretty basic stuff for you guys. It sends a message to another system so there's an energy source involved in that like battery or solar power. Something along those lines. There's an integrated circuit just the microchip and that actually composed the messages and usually the way a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system. User interface controls the chip basically that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as well. So my findings I just did a preliminary study here and I found that too much metal and remote design can potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands and too much metal can cause remote to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals. Too much metal is sometimes people pick up radio signals and the like and there's lots of the possibility of remote catching on fire and injuring the customer. Just think of those lawsuits now would be really bad. Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction. Components just some ideas that I had energy source. It's kind of hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup. The user interface I was, since we can't use metal, I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic. The chip silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that. We can't really be different in that respect. The sender, while I'm thinking infrared because it is the industry standard multi channel that's the word I made up. I don't really know what it means. Pal and NTSC compatible and probably a 200 foot range. And the receiver of course is a number of electronic devices. But in this case the only VTBs. Personal preferences. I really think that we should use plastic as a post metal company simply kind of forward this kind of lawsuits. Which admittedly is going to come at the cost of certain aesthetic value because we were thinking. Is there a way that we can use modern types of polymers or modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value? Like if we talk about like on the laptop on these laptops and other things, it's a pretty nice. Is there some kind of nice color there in quality, plastic that we can work with? Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem. For example, the plastic they have in the laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do. Great. Thank you very much, Nathan. If next we can have the user interface developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that would be great as well. Let's plug yourself in here. Hit functioner fade real quickly. Hold down. Is it plugged in while? There it goes. Periodjustice. Sweet. Well, so here we have my technical function design presentation. So, a few of the requirements we need here. We basically need to operate an electronic device. It needs to be universal. And possibly operate several different types of devices, although we now find that. Yeah, sorry, I couldn't get that get to you before I know from. So, some of my findings basically want to send messages to a television set. That would be any number of different things such as switch on the television such as an external, that sort of thing I think we're all quite intelligent and know what a normal remote control does. Now, some of the other things I found is a complicated remote control. I'm sorry that we can't wait. We might read there very well that this remote control has many functions. So, it can do a lot of things, but it is quite complicated and most users will find it. Find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't want to take the time to learn how to do it. As you also notice, it's quite a boring design. Another remote control slightly different. It's a simple remote control. Many less buttons, but has many fewer functions. Much easier for the user to manipulate and use. It also has a bit of a cheap look and is also quite boring. So, my personal process is revolutionized the idea of a remote control. So, attain the functionality of a complicated device, but use a simple format of display for the user to work with. Now, it's going to add another slide here, but I didn't play half time there. Okay, just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously, like having multiple faceplates and one. Great, thanks for that run. I mean, that's you. I think so. Okay. I can plug you up. Oh, that would be perfect. Thank you. Slide down. Or it not? Give it a little bit. Okay. So, this is me. Basically, I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got. We had a usability test where we were actually, like watching 100 people use TV remotes and see what it is that they're using. And then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general TV remote control practices. And then we were able to do so much through testing. We were finding out that most of the time everybody's just using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume. The majority of the time that's all that's going on. The other functions happen for some people. They're important, but the primary uses are really, really basic. And so big, complicated remotes, like one we saw in the last presentation, are really not the general public's use. They don't need it. They even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons they don't want to do with. And we also found out that 50% of our people, they're the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it. And then they can't find it in the room. So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, we're really coming to play with a lot of these people. There's also a survey about what they liked about the remote. And pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful. And the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options. I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically. That's up to the design people. But it is something we're thinking about, especially since the younger demographics obviously the one that's going to keep growing. So if that's the direction we're headed in, it's something to think about. But basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are the standards. So it's a good start for us. That's great. Thank you, Sarah. Right. So yeah, I'll just switch that back here. I'll finish up, which is a bit of discussion. I'll plan on for the next phase. Right. So I think we've covered most of these important questions through this. Through you guys' presentations. We've got the industrial designer suggests, or pretty much, infatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simple or functions. So fewer functions. But we need to decide who we're selling this to. Your stat suggested that 75% of people under 35 want to thought about voice control. So do we want to go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic? And my thought is we've got, if we're going to go for a sleek look, I mean we are putting the fashion and electronics. We're not catering to the pensioners of the world that we'll take. So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic. So we need to wonder how we can make it better and smaller and faster. We're constrained to plastic very well. We've got this idea. We're almost saying we need to think about revolutionizing the way it's looking. Which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for tele. So this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea. Assuming that it's doable. At least for the basic controls. Maybe we can balance it that way. We can see, okay, you can't say record alias tonight. We might be able to say volume up. Right. I think it'd be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology. Oh, that could work. I like that. With a simple command like locate. Yeah. Something very basic. It could start to be. Right. Or before we found. Is that only going to be within our 200 foot range then? Oh yeah, I think that's right. The difficulty what would be in I think like it. You couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find. Can you have something that picks up? A voice from far away. It's a good point. It's hidden under the couch. But then again, you have this we this we think, you know, they're just a little chip or whatever that has the page button. Maybe that could be always activated too. A little sticky pad to stick on top of your television. Yeah. And you say something to that. Yeah. Yeah. Or an isolated magnet or something like, you know, something that wouldn't interfere. I don't know the technical thing. But yeah, I like that. I like that. The voice recognition to the paging system. The thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control. So it could be sold to both the younger market, the older market. The younger market could use kind of the voice control method. The older market might make it just option. Exactly. And we might consider the older market could use this in poor design, but the traditional buttons and whatnot. I was thinking. You know what the screen, sorry. I'll go ahead. If we're going to do this touchpad screen thing, and we still do we know if that's an option technically right now. Definitely an option. I've looked into a cost of touch screen and whatnot. This is to be, you know, almost as cheap as a button method at this point. It seems like an interesting option, especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these, you know, four or five basic functions. And you have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition settings. Things that you're not going to use every day and that a lot of people aren't going to use, but it is an option there for this high tech market that sort of be. Is this leak thing we're going for? I've got a wonder there for adding so much technology to this one remote. I was still going to be able to meet a 12 or 12 50 euro gold for selling these things. It seems like you're not going to be able to handle all those functions with just one microchip. The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the whole mechanism. Yeah. It's just something to consider. Absolutely. Okay. Well, yeah, I guess we'll cross that bridge in a later stages of development. But yeah, no, it's perfectly viable question. Okay. So I'm seeing that we're going to just basically focus on this young demographic. Aim it at them, but then in a sense that it's bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them, but basically we'll make a sleek, simple functioned. Remote control. I think this voice recognition thing is we've got a market for it. I don't think there's too many. We more or less be cornering the market on as well. We don't have many. Yeah. Compared to a lost my microphone. Right. We don't have many people. There's not very many competitors out there that do that. So cool. Right. I guess we've touched on most of this. The idea of a paging function, a touch screen, and face plates. The thing with I see, would there not be a, we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen. I'm not sure that's sincerely correct. I think you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that kind of has a portion of the device is not interchangeable. The surrounding questions are interchangeable. We could have the casing. Yeah. The face plates. Okay. Back to the, the costs, the material. We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package. That's something I would say we're including three or four face plates. This can drive the costs up. And the other questions, if we don't include them, are we really in a position to evaluate that market? We haven't done any tests on face plates. Whether, see if there's even interest out there. Okay. I have to talk my head. It sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere. Yeah, because it would have to, who all, it's not like with cell phones like we have a, you know, a Nokia model X. And then 10 people make face plates for it. Yeah. We just are a model of remote control. One of the publicity of a face phone on a phone is you have it out and around. And you have to sort of emblematic whereas you're just sitting at home. So unless somebody comes over to watch TV. Yeah. Well, hopefully some people have people coming over to watch. True. Most people have their televisions in the living room. All right. Well, we can, we can discuss that one further when we think about whether, when we do costs and so forth. True, plastic is dead cheap. And if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway. We'll cross-apparage later. But yeah, we will have to evaluate what's most important. I think we've had a bit of discussion already on these things. Any other questions, comments that came up in these presentations? Well, have we confirmed that we're going to go ahead with a top screen? Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, I think that would be best. Let's based on what you guys have all said to me. Let's go for a plastic built or a plastic case. Because that this is easy on the cost. Try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended. That's a great idea. With a touch screen for the basic functions. And we'll, yeah, provisionally let's go for a touch screen. We're with several sub menus for possible extra stuff that want to basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen. Do we have, wait a minute, it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen, people are going to have to recharge their remote controls. Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost. So it would have a docking base. Then again, that costs as well. So it's new with the last 20 years, even with the touch screen. Do they? Okay. Give me a 4x and crew line. And we'll somebody buy it if we tell the day. Well, I don't think yeah, I can't see anybody buying a remote control that we have to plug in. So we have to see some kind of new battery technology. Okay. So let's go with a touch screen. With some kind of, you know, with some cutting edge battery technology. For 12 year olds. Yeah, well, hey, you know, it's worth looking into. If not, we can always default to just doing a well presented plastic simple. You know, well, yeah, I mean, you can put that we could add or know. I mean, I suppose we could put the basics on the center easiest, you know, you know, people know the channel volume function. Make them large and easy to get at. And then the other, the other bits and bobs, you know, go through many. We'll do the aesthetics. Okay. So look for the touchscreen in the battery. Focus on presentation. With this voice recognition option as well. Just for the simple functions, the on off channels volume. Great. And a small paging function, even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging, you know, just some kind of simple button that's just, I guess, another infrared signal to the remote control and well to emit some kind of paging. Okay. Right. So any comments? Thoughts before we break into going to the next round of individual work on this. Since we're doing touchscreen, we want to look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the, you know, the actual interface part of it. Things like that. Or is it just going to be one touchscreen for everybody? Interesting. What would be on that touchscreen? Because you said earlier that we have to think about company colors and logo or something or model. I can't exactly say. We put fashion to the electronics. It's my understanding that if you're going to do a skin, you need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control. Yeah, I think perhaps it's too much. Good idea. But yeah, I think that that one might just be. Yeah, I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular. A pda would make a lot of sense for a pda because you're going to be using it to connect up to things anyway. I don't know what you guys think. I think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touchscreen. Yeah, okay. I'm in agreement with that. I'm wondering how we're going to get to, we put fashion into electronics. But if we're going to use a touchscreen where it's going to come on, like on your cell phone, it'll have your, your carrier provider name come up first like well, it's loading and then it goes away. Perhaps it can be like a temporary. It comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it because it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back. Yeah, true. Yeah, I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a second as a trick. Yeah, yeah, no, it seems like it would suffice to just have the RR on there. Yeah, you would think, but. But apparently not. People are going to want their remote to boot up and see flashing things. I just want to be on ready to go. Well, fair enough. Any of that would help the battery life to you if the remote, they do have to press about it for their month to turn on. Then again, who wants to turn on or look at all? Well, you have to do this touch screen and it automatically. It'll wake up. Okay, I'll go into it back to the dormant mode. Okay. Yeah, I like that. I like the idea of putting the logo in the boot up screen. Nice. Cool. So any last things before you break? All right, fair enough. Sounds good. I'm going to save the copy of this case you guys need to remind us. I'm going to save a copy of this and the main set. I'll do in a second and put them in the share folder for a later reference. Let's put my files in the share folder. Brilliant. That's fab guys.",

        "meeting_id": "ES2009c",
        "transcript": " That's great. Okay. All right. Let me just PowerPoint this out. All right. Let me just PowerPoint this out. All right. So this meeting will be about the conceptual design. Don't ask me precisely what conceptual design is. It's just something important that we need to do. I think it's kind of turning the abstract into slightly more concrete and this meeting ideally will come to some final decisions on what we're going to do for the prototype. Right. So apologies for the last meeting. It was brought to my attention that I did not make the rules clear enough. So I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting. There are enough. Thanks for the input. It's always good. So basically all we're going to do is have some presentations again much like last time. I'm going to go through you. Whoever wants to go first is fine by me and we'll collate what we know about what we discussed in the last meeting possible directions. And then we'll make some more decisions on basic firm up our idea how we want this remote control to look and work. So perfect. So without further ado, whoever wants to go first is free to go first. All right. Take it away. It is Nathan. I'm not calling the wrong name over Nathan's fire. Good. I'm not going to call it Nathan or participant to Mr. participant to that. Okay. Nice. Basically what I'm going to have to talk to you about today is component design. And it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers. Basically what I'm going to be doing is talking to you about that component of remote control. We've already kind of gone over this but we're going to have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions sometimes soon. Energy source. Our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources. Your standard battery. Solar cells. Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium. So we might have to look. If we do go that route, we might have to look elsewhere. And also there's a kinetic energy possibility. Basically it's like an idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running. So that's one possible. But I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touchscreen. So we'll have to look into that. The case we have a few options. Plastic rubber or wood. And then as far as the way it's shaped we can do standard born flat which we probably don't want to do. Curved or very sexy double curved. What kind of thickness are we looking at? Imagine that we could specify. I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimeters. The buttons. There are multiple scope buttons available for a manufacturer. But to use those who would have to use more chips. And that would cost us more. And if we do go with rubber double curved case. We'll have to use rubber push buttons. Because the other buttons aren't compatible with that. And just a little note there touch screen equals many chips which equals many hero. And the other thing that I noticed is that most remotes operate on the infrared part of the spectrum. So you notice when you push upon a remote you can't see anything coming out of it. But in fact there is light coming out of the remote and the television can detect that. And if you were to record, if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light. So one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the mode just kind of as a fun gimmick. So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you push it. Of course they have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human. Maybe is there an option that we could have that offer on so a person could select like. Yeah, I'm sure that we could do that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, just as a fun gimmick. Just set us apart a little bit. And then onto the circuit board that we're going to use also moves the chip. We really don't have any where around the TA 11835. Findings. Okay, we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer. And my question to all of you is should we look to other manufacturers which is making to you with what we have available. Interesting question. A bit of a challenge question. Like say shop around but with our time constraints is that really a piece of options. Right, that's my concern too. If we do go to the lithium battery routes then we'll have to go outside. My personal preferences I'll just throw my cards on the table. I think we should probably go to solar battery route. Just kind of keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on. I like the idea that visible light signaling is something to set us apart. And I was thinking about. I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes. So we're not so confined by one style and say so. Say I'd the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation. Can we do marketing piloting to try to see what kind before we launch? Can we see how they received? It's an option. Actually I've got some research already on what we're looking at and trends in casing right now. Which actually might even come into play beforehand. Okay perfect. Great thank you very much. It's perfect. So I guess that makes sense for you to take your perimeter. I guess so. Because I found some interesting things. Fascinating. I know. I wanted to hear it. Right. So current market trends. Screen. Basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now. And what's going on in other design fields to see sort of what's what's trendy what's new what's happening. Remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer fancier more exciting their sake of this boring normal functional that we need innovative design options and it needs to be an easy user interface. The challenge is that current trends right now across the board in fashion in furniture in technology is a very organic. A very comfortable kind of thing. Now we're not saying we should have you know tomato shaped remote controls or anything but I think it is possible maybe to use natural colors like if wood is an option that whole organic sleek clean. I think that's fine thing maybe so we can look into different skin options or if we can't afford this touch plate thing or touch face screen interface maybe having the images be specific like you could choose your menu bullets to be. Okay not the example I would choose but you know what I mean to sort of and apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy not something I come up with a definitely a strand though if we can get around to getting piloting I thought maybe a casing option like a. Not like a skin but like a holder almost if you could do like leather options or wood options or something I should have mentioned this as far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case it has a consistency of those stress balls. So I think we should stick with what we're finding every is looking for easy use technology innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now. Oh the interface graphics for the well I but then if touch screen thing is work out for us that's really no issue. I like the idea of rubber it's here because it's 10 set be associated with being durable something that you can drop and it doesn't matter so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote control. Very true. Yeah it's like with duct tape. Very much so. You wouldn't have that from the side. You think we could have a duct tape. I think that goes against the whole fancy something. But worth a shot. The granola crowd. Yeah that's what I know. Great thanks for that Sarah. No problem. Ron. Here is a just one moment. So interface concept by your faithful user interface. So user interface guys is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or here or otherwise perceive commands and mechanisms that basically user uses to control the operating operating system. Here's a series of different remote controls that are out on the market today. I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look. Yeah. So the following are a bunch of different interface concepts. Voice recognition. We actually have some new information from our research design team but get to that in a moment. So current voice recognition starts up to about 80 speech samples. And basically you record your own verbal labels and connect them to the remote control. Now our design team research team has been able to set up a system in which you can teach the remote control voice recognition system to respond to you with standard responses like you could say good morning. In fact we already have this for a copy maker line. A lot of single people in the other remote control. Another concept is what Apple has come up with. The spinning wheel with LC display like on the iPods which I'm sure most you know. And then we have this scroll button with the indicator push button like a modern boss of embalty a bit crazy. I don't think that's what we're necessarily going for. And some special components ideas like blocking having the ability to block channels from your for your children. And dedicated buttons for commonly used channels. And even ideas like secured or hidden programming. But again if we go with text screen I don't think that's a big issue. And this is kind of the big daddy of the jumpal universal remote control is almost impossible to miss places. Again probably not what we're going for. So I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod with a hard classic classic casing. Well I think some of the suggestions would come up with are definitely very good ideas. Changeable casings of our design team was possibly talking about including one extra faceplate with a package to kind of set the idea that you can change it. And you can try changing and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our bottom line touch screen interface possibly having go to buttons being stuck into the system. So those don't move away from the screen. The important ones like power volume and jump between channels. And of course our voice commands is to which I've talked a little bit about already. And the use of recognizable colors in shape state recognition of the features that are around so red per power arrows for different volume ups and downs and towns ups and downs and whatnot. And perhaps you are adding in some super low jokes with the voice recognition idea. Like for instance my toasty maker that I got from my bank has jokes when it's ready. Nice. Great and that is about it. Great wonderful run. Cool. A lot of good ideas, good facts to have. That's what they need. It's like a little dongle. It just sticks up this further. So you don't have to stand up every time. Right. So good to know all that stuff. Thanks guys. We know we can have to come to some decisions. Figure we can just go to the line all three of us can have a chat about it. Based on what Nathan presented as far as the various costs and benefits. I think I don't know what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point. I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places. But can we really afford it because it looks like they would be that would be a really main cost source then right. My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology is going to cost those upwards of 1750 euro. That's pretty much what it is. That's just an estimate. Well you guys are always the dampers on these. You're industrial design. I know. And our goal was to be under 1250 or we have to be under 1250. Well, I thought there was some flexibility with that. There is. It's just it is a question of how much does that mean we're going to have to increase the price to make money. From 1250 if we want to get a 100% profit margin that would mean selling it for 25. If you multiply 1750 by 2 that's 35. So where do you guys come up with these numbers? I just have to talk my head. It is pending for their emails from the board. Well, do I think that's what people would pay for? If you're going to pay for an expensive high class remote you're going to expect to do something. That's true. It would be in a class of a term. And that's to be fair. The percent of the market we're not going for mass sales anyway. We're going to make. I mean we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things. We just couldn't not for 25 euros. We could probably maybe shrink the profit margin rather than selling for 25, sell them for 30. But that's something we can have finance deal with. I say that we provisionally go with the tax screen. What was your thought of the matter on? I'm thinking that's definitely a good idea. And I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper means to go about this kind of production. My team and the on the third floor suggested that. Well, we can look into this other manufacturing option. You can get them somewhere else cheaper. That's true. We could initially go with what we have and we're freaking finding. Starting point anyway. We could have a very simple touch screen. There's always the opportunity. It's going to be about the size of the iPod or whatever. I guess we can play around with it a bit. Let's say the touch screen will be our main selling point here. I think that we really have two main selling points. I think that our casing and the voice record. Really, this is pretty bells and whistles kind of remote. The voice rack thing. If we're looking at bottom line, now we're looking at uping the cost of 17 to get the touch screen on. I think we might have to drop the voice rack. I think we'd have to decide between them definitely. To be honest, we have the design in-house. We've come up with this. We're using a perikoppy machine already. I can pass you on that email from my guy down the hall. Sounds good. What do you think on anything about the voice rack? I think if we do both, the production costs are going to go up. But it does put it into, it becomes the role's rise of remote control basically. Pretty low. Very nice. We have to reflect back on what our market research did. They said they wanted voice recognition. Of course, maybe they hadn't thought of this little touch screen option. But definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition. We have the technology and we're not going to use it even though we know it will sell. It's a call I don't think I can give the high-ups. I can't go ahead and say no, we're going to stick to everything we know. Yeah. Does having both really up our costs? I can't see how it wouldn't. There's the old aphorism. You can have it fast, you can have it cheap, you can have it quality. Pick two of three. You can't have all three of it. Because you're just a number of chips you need to deal with each different function. Well, if we're going to pick between one of the two. Otherwise, yeah, it just becomes cost prohibitive. Which do we suspect we should hold on to? Well, we already have research backing voice recognition as you know, basically solvent. But I personally would tend to get the direction, but if that's what's going to sell, I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touchscreen for our next model. I would have to side with that. I think the voice recognition is simpler. We already have all the technology in the house that's ready to go. It's packaged. What does the cost look like? Well, it's cheaper than the VR to do the touchscreen. Well, it's just off the top of my head. I keep it warm. But I think the voice recognition, they're both going to push the cost up. But since we already have the technology in the house for the voice recognition, we're not going to have to do as much design work. Sometimes design work is what push the cost up. If you know what I mean. Definitely have to agree with that. Then we don't have to deal with this battery issue really as much either. We can stick with what we've already got in a lot of other ways too. So I'm getting, all right, so more or less you guys think that of the two of them, the voice recognition will be better. I think it's our lower risk option. Which right now we can have it on the market sooner, which is all in all our best options. Okay, sorted. We will omit the touchscreen in favor of voice recognition. So, and when are we going to have basic prototypes coming up next? That's you guys next step, right? Yeah, well, we'll sort out what else we're going to talk about more prototype. But yeah, that's our next step. Are we going to talk now about the materials we're going to use for the case? We'll just run through it. Yeah, yeah. You discussed either a lithium or a solar power, would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition or this kinesthetic one? Would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition removal control? The solar power definitely would be, but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed, because sometimes solar power fails, there's no around that. We should install a small backup battery just to cover those moments when, whatever reason, the remote has a box of it. We'll also use TV in their basement, like where? Yeah. We can't guarantee some of it everywhere, so having a detector resource is probably... It works about the same as a solar powered calculator. And you know how those, those don't really require that much light. True. Obviously, a little more light than a calculator, but we're not talking about a lot of light. It doesn't have to be out taking a sun bath. Right. Right. For a stay or anything. Okay. What do you think, Ron? I'm willing to do a review with everything that's been said. Okay. I have to say, though, that another idea has come up in my head. If we're really not handling the remote control to a great extent, we could possibly get away from the idea of having a handheld remote control, and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that. Kind of a sweet little, uh, anything that sits on your table or something. Interesting. Yes, I thought. Why I'm moving away from handheld? Why? It's the... Well, if you don't need to pick it up, it could kind of be a selling point. It's got voice recognition. It can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job. Do you think people that are... People that buy your motor, they're always going to want to use the voice recognition. It's just something that they do sometimes. True. And probably, I think we're bang on selling it to more than just voice recognition people. Like, we want it to work fundamentally. We have that button on it too as well. But that's done. That's no bother. I mean, if you look at the catalog from places that we show up in Reminds or whatever, you know, they might have or like, um, who is it? Apple makes these really pretentious speakers, with the subwoofers, you know, like, clear and glass and, you know, they got the little pyramidal type of speakers. I mean, why not have a little rounded kind of thing? It could still have the basic buttons on it. Because we're going for basic functionality primarily as well. It's about, yeah. And maybe a menu button, so forth, you know, um, use the channel button to scroll through the menu if they want to record programs or whatever, you know. I think you're onto something because we need to escape the traditional shape of remote. Maybe something that looks nice on a table is, would be good, even though, and handheld at the same time. I think it's all about following Apple's lead. I don't know, a lot of people. Yeah, I'm thinking of the airport portal. You know, like that little pod looking thing? Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I, although we do, um, we're calling what she mentioned, we need to get away from the surgical white kind of brush to the little one I'm thinking, get back to it. But you could have a very tasteful, um, wood colored or earth tone kind of, um, terracotta bowl or something. Still, I mean, yeah, along those lines. Yeah, I like that. I like that idea a lot. Um, let's see what we can do as far as that goes. And the, uh, the material like the plastics and so forth, we were discussing that being, uh, using like a rubber kind of softer feel. Um, you know, I, if you feel a, the tip on this pen is a bit, gives just a bit. Yeah. You know, something where it's a, a more advanced form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it. Right. Just kind of this squishy feel. Yeah. Which is the next big thing. So that's not going to hurt us either. Yeah, let's see if we can do a squishy non remote control looking remote control. But to be fair, yeah, I mean, you just, you could just put it, literally put it on the, the night, the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up. I like it. I like that. Yeah. That's good. Um, and we've sort of discussed costs. Um, I guess we'll all, that's going to be, uh, I think if we run a bit over by, if we run a bit over budget, it might be okay. Um, sorry about the lack of information costs. I just haven't been provided information by many countries. We'll have more ideas with the prototype. We'll have more of that later on. Um, we'll just, yeah, we'll go from there. Um, so we've revisited the touchscreen and more or less ruled that out. Um, I think so we're more or less can, we, we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a, um, a simple kind of function, you know, not too complex. Right. Well, when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis, although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions, they should be secondary, at least if not functionally, then visually like those shouldn't be. Right. I think we have many things. Take good things. If, if we're not going to touchscreen route, then we can, um, just incorporate maybe something that folds out. Like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here. Something that slides down and to reveal, you know, the more complicated things. Yeah. Well, we want to consider like an iPod screen, which isn't a touch screen, but you're still scrolling through menu options. And then we're hitting our cost issue again. And we've also got the, the thing of, we're going to have a non-remote looking remote. How do we, yeah. But no, I mean, we could do a slide or a compartment, you know, like if it's say it's a little vaguely avoidable type of thing, it'd be easy to have a compartment in there, or you know, a, a series of, you know, three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side and up and down type of thing like on a, like on a DVD player. You know, you see the modern DVD players, they'll just have a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them. And you can just kind of, maneuver through the menu like that. So are we going, are we talking, we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use, are we going to use scroll buttons, rubber buttons. Well, it seems like, no, no, it seems to me that we could just do the, um, stick with the rubber, because it's probably going to be using some kind of, um, rubber for the outside case, you know, as we'll stick with that. Great. I think to a certain extent we have to stick with, uh, kind of a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then, and then make our unique future our chasing and whatnot and our voice can that. Well, those basic just like four directions that are, that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you want to do it, are really versatile and. Every's already got them to some extent, I'm a most dirty owned so it's not like we're dealing with every re learning things because that's not something anybody's going to want to buy before. Right. Okay. Um, we've already kind of covered this as well. That seems to be selling. Um, and we're more or less agree that we want to target this youth market. Um, especially now with 18 of 35 year olds being so large quantity of the population, particularly in technological fields. So, um, it's exactly what we're headed. Okay. Um, yeah, all right. Well, more or less covered what we need to cover, I think, find, even you find the thoughts before we think about doing the product, moving out of the prototype. Well, what are we actually doing? I was just going to step on to, um, Oh, it wasn't in the way, but it wasn't my bad. Sorry. Yeah, okay. I was just going to assign tasks in the next year. Any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool. So, have we decided that we are going to go with different style cases for different people? Or are we just going to go with one? It's very, it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit, obviously, but you have just one case and it doesn't go over well. Yeah, it's a situation, but obviously having more cases also costs more. Well, then again, colors wouldn't be so hard to do. You could have a kind of a natural wood color, like a stained wood, I don't know, olive green or something. That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the color of the rubber, I don't think. And again, copying iMacs kind of for iPod Mac Apple's color scheme. Yeah, totally. Yeah, I think that's probably good. Okay, so let's work on multiple case colors. But yeah, stick with the same kind of, kind of, yeah, the same basic non-remote kind of remote design. Cool. All right, so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour. I'd like Nathan to work on just the basic look and feel. What can we accomplish given these parameters that we sort of out this kind of non-remote remote? What are our broad constraints before we design a prototype? And Ron, if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of the simple design with the voice recognition built in, and also this kind of drop down or on the side kind of menu options simple, somehow work out how we can get this all in the same place. And if you can check product evaluation, we can do some pilots and stuff. I need you guys to work together on making a prototype using prototype building materials. And also specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well. So that's what to start with for now. That's all right, guess we're clear about this. Let's get fabulous. All right. Just hit the bricks. Thanks guys. Cool.",
        "abstract": "The Industrial Designer presented an analysis of cost and the manufacturing options that were available to the group. The Marketing Expert presented market trends and the organic trend that this project would adopt. She discussed materials that could be used to follow this trend. The User Interface Designer presented several interface concepts including voice recognition, a spinning wheel design, and a touch screen interface. The group then discussed the features of the device. They discussed the costs and benefits of using either voice recognition or the touch screen interface, and decided on voice recognition based on their marketing data that favored it. They decided to use solar power to power the device. The group discussed the non-traditional look the device could have since the voice recognition would allow it to be stationary. They discussed using rubber for the case. The group talked about hiding the complicated functions from the main interface, using rubber for the buttons, and having different cases to suit different tastes. The Project Manager reiterated that the product was being marketed towards the youth market, and then gave out assignments and instructed the group to work together to build the prototype.",

        "transcript": " commencement work of Friedado We, the ba What? Oh, I told me the exit moved it. I just put it over here. You know, do I have to wait for this? How's that? Cool. Oh, right. It is PowerPoint time. I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment. Yeah. Just kind of fun. Oh, my. So here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype and, right. So I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my, that my coach was sending to me. It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting. Oh, really? I think. I don't know. Otherwise, it's just saying, I'm the secretary, and therefore I'm taking the minutes. So just to go, just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting, I will open them slowly. No. Wait for it. Wait for it. Yeah, that's not you. Wait. This is a very high-powered stuff here. That will click here. There we go. So basically the moral of the story from our last meeting was that we had meetings from, we had presentations done by the industrial designer, or from Nathan and Ron and Sarah, about what we can do here, and what sort of limitations we're operating with, or excuse me, limitations we're operating under, what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing. And we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with our voice recognition that had a vaguely non-remote-like shape, because you didn't really use it as a remote, it says you could just use your voice. That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation, but with a slider full-out bay for more advanced functions for users. And the, the, the, the idea and the idea were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype press to look at. So, that sorted back to the main, meet here. Go ahead and take it away, guys. Well, we have assembled our prototype, what's to be said about it. We took into account a lot of things that we went over in the last meeting. Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen, which you can see, and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions. This is going to be the on and off button, and we have these buttons to go through the channels, and then two volume buttons down here. We decided those were the most important buttons. And then for the more advanced functions, there's a slide out panel here. You can see that a lot of sort of things going on. But this actually can slide back in. It's very nice aesthetic when it's all put away. As far as the whole visible light thing, we decided to go with multiple colors. Why not? Of course, if that's annoying for some people, that function can be turned off. Perfect. Now, it's important that we talked a bit about the interchangeable faces, and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here. We call it fruity. Of course, that's interchangeable, and I think it would be desirable for the regular product in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued, but this is kind of something that can be done. And as you can see on the television there, we have the voice detector device on the top. So that will work quite well with regard to finding this contraption. What other things do we see here? Well, if you give it a touch, it does have actually a bit of a spongey feel. So I think that will work well with regard to our market. And let's see. Well, clearly there's going to be some more colors and whatnot available. Do you have anything else to add to that? I've worried about the materials. The entire thing is covered in rubber coating. It's very durable. It's not going to break like some type of plastic that's dropped. And of course, as you can see, if you touch it, it does have that nice squishy feel. It's actually important to note that the television, if there's an earthquake or anything like that, it actually is edible inside. I don't know if you noticed, but I wrote the company's name. Oh, well done. This is actually an apple inside. Do we need to worry about broad factors? It's encased in a new type of thing. Okay, this is preserved as well. We got to go ahead of ourselves. I know we're not talking about making televisions. It's the way we have the future. It's a couple of years off at least. Impossible new product. But I think that sums up the main features of the remote. I don't know if you guys have any questions or whether we need to worry about any other marketing areas or anything of that. Nature, did we come in under budget? We did. This costs, well, to put this into production, looking at about, was our goal was 1250 euro. This actually came at about $11.99. I was quite pleased with that. One thing that we didn't do, obviously we had a choice with the buttons, whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons. But we just went for a classic rubber button. Since we did that, we didn't have to use as many microchips, which was quite nice. That's what helped keep the cost down. Even though it has a lot of modern technology, for example, the voice recognition. A lot of ways it's just a simple remote. I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers, we might be able to get it even cheaper. Did we talk about the voice recognition option? I don't know. We haven't talked about it yet. On the back here, you'll notice this area here, which is actually the voice recognition console. I think it's nicely designed into the overall look. But basically, the voice recognition incorporates the latest designs that our research team has come up with. Basically, quite similar to the coffee maker design that we were talking about earlier. I think that has given a proven ease of use and whatnot. Yeah. And allows features like the remote to actually talking back to the user. Cool. Any questions? No, no. Do we have other, for lack of a word, skins, covers, and play now are those going to be developed later? Once we see how the couple we have go, or do we stand on that? Well, we didn't quite have enough material. Oh, I was expecting a prototype. I just don't know if you guys had any in mind. Right. Well, as you can see, this is just a most superficial layer. And it'd be very easy to put another layer. Something else. Something else. Yeah. Okay. Actually, this bottom red ring here just unclips. And then you put a new, a new, a new, a new plate on top of that. So I mean, there are, we definitely priced out a sponge, even spongeier, non-natural look materials, which I think worked out fine. We also continued on with the ideas that following apples, color schemes, with kind of the light orange and slime. It's not quite a face plate. It's more like a pseudo face plate. Okay. Because it's simple enough that in the factory, we could very easily put a different one on it. It locks into place such that, you know, it's pretty permanent. But at the same time, if we want to go the other way, it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments. We could go the face plate way. If you know what I mean. Yep. It's still an option. Yeah. Very cool. Nice job. Right. Yeah. Thanks, guys. That's very, very good work. I like it. Brilliant. What we need to discuss now is the finance of it. You've got me, you've got provided a number that actually sounds quite nice. The trouble is I was just given this by finance. It's a spreadsheet of the parts. And I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like. I'm just going to clear this out real quickly. But it looks like. So we'll just, if we can just itemize what's in here, we've got this. It's a solar cell thing, right? Right. With the backup battery. It's enough. It's about, okay. And the worst recognition area actually doubles as. As the solar cell area. Clever. Well done. So I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a. It's a speaker in a sense or at the same time isn't it? Yeah. It's just making use of the same space and the same materials. But in the case, it's more of a single curved case. I guess it would be that the general. Yeah, one big curve. I guess you could say. And we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout. Push button interface with this other drop down. Maybe we've got two push button interfaces. Yeah. And special. I guess it's a, we've got a sort of a wood material, a rubbery type material. Yeah. Special throughout. Yeah. I guess you'd have to mark special color and special form as well. It's a very unconventional. Yeah, it's quite unique. I like it. Yeah. So it looks like. 16. A bit over budget. Oh. Just a chat to sit. So what we could do perhaps, a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells or take out the backup battery. I mean, I think that if we were talking about it being one of our main selling features, being environmental without the batteries and whatnot, although it does still have a battery, I'm not sure what the solar cell is. I mean, we could take the battery out of it, you see. And it probably worked 99% of the time, but you're going to have to set up a call center for that 1% of the time when people are calling and saying, oh, look, my remote isn't working. What am I going to do? Where are your people people that have set? I think in a long run, it's better to keep the battery. And it's hard to scrap the whole solar battery idea because that's so integral to the theme that we have. Hmm. Hmm. Well, it's difficult. We have all these things integral to the, um, two to the design of it that we just can't back out of now. It would have to be, seems like we'd have to go back to square one. In a way. Um, if we were going to try that and do one bit, we probably have to undo most of it. Yeah. Although we don't want to get rid of the whole environmental, I mean, obviously, the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marking this is like a natural new thing. But honestly, if we cut that one piece out, we're actually coming in on the budget, if I've done my math correctly. I mean, you might be able to sway me on the idea that our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing. I mean, that's what sets us apart, right? Yeah, that's what setting us into this young market. And that's what we started from. So. I don't know. And I mean, you know, perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price, we can bring that back into the game. But it looks like at this point that may be out of our league. And the reality is, you know, for me, from an ideological standpoint, I'd like to stick with the solar cell, but I kind of have to throw myself in the business structure and model here. Yeah, I think either or I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project without the solar cell. Yeah. I think that's fortunately that's our best option. Anyway, we're going to get below goals and 1250 because we can't remove the push buttons because they are. Yeah, we can't get rid of the, I mean, removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of a norm would change in the case materials. So yeah, that looks like to be the only thing. So that would be it's a major change, but yeah. Alright, so we're in agreement on that. Unfortunately, I think we are. I think that was a good compromise about for. Right. Moving along swiftly. So I guess now we just go to the project evaluation, which I will allow. That will be me. Cored? Of course, sorry. No problem. You reach. That would be great. Thank you. That would be great. I didn't even do that on purpose either. Okay. Basically, I was just evaluating. From what we know of our products working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do. These are the things that look like we feel are important. So I was looking at basic design things. Does it fulfill its function as a remote? Is the design what we wanted to do? Our technologies up to where we'd hope they would be and does a fulfill the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for. Basic questions like, you know, does it turn on? Does it respond to voice recognition? And overall, in general, it looks like it's coming up to par. The only thing is with the pull out panel that is going to take some adjusting because of the new sort of interface. That looked like it was coming up rough. But then once you get used to it, it does make a lot of sense. So I think overall we're heading the right direction. Like that spongy feel. Yeah. It looks like it's going over well. The page function works well. That's good to hear. We're good. Yeah. I think eventually if we do branch out with this program, maybe when we do have higher budget options and if it goes over with this model, we can look into wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff. But for now, what we've got is working in the range we need it for. So it's all good. That's a good point for me. But losing the solar panel. Yeah. It's okay. Yeah. It is a setback, but. Okay. Do you need the quid back? Yeah. We might have lost that granola market again. Oh, they don't want to tell you anyway. Do they? I guess the chair is true. Right. So this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair. I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to. So I guess we are going to discuss. Project process. And that is going to go into my report. So I guess this is the point where we go. Okay. All right. That looks like a roll that looks like in talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth. Okay. How that all worked. I guess as in within the team. I think so. Yeah. Right. So it's just kind of. I think it's a mic kind of thing. It is now. So, okay. Yeah, whatever. Right. So, any thoughts? We can start at these points here. Yeah. I think they're starting blocks, yeah. What did you guys feel about the process? Yes. You know, I think in general, for a day's worth of work, we actually were relatively productive, considering the little amount of input we had going in. And the technology has definitely been a help. It's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff. We didn't use the whiteboard at all. No, no whiteboard. We could now, if that had made up for it, really. And I feel like if you guys had been designing in here, perhaps that would have changed, but because of the room constraints, it doesn't really matter. Also, had I not been intrigued about the pen? I don't think I would have used it at all. I didn't write barely anything. Yeah, I think I was taking notes more often than usual just coming back to the pen. That's true. Yeah. It was a pretty cool pack though. That's fine. I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach. Yeah, is your regular personal coach? Yeah, but I didn't get her. So, what if you get a response two or three months from now? I don't know if you kind of creepy. That tempts the contact coach in a second. Well, what kind of coaching is that really? What if I really needed something? So, I think there was a lot of room for creativity. We could do whatever basically we wanted until the budget came down on us. And even then, we did get a decent product or no, although it's not everything we wanted it to be. Yeah, with the natural look. It's very natural look. Organic, really. It's brilliant. So, they had a peeler in here. And highly resourceful teammates might I add, which is always a plus. Yeah, I thought it was really creative, actually. Yeah, I'm impressed. The teamwork was good. The proof that we were always full. We didn't waste a single bit of play to waste every day. Nice. All four of those little containers. Yeah. Including the multicolored wave pattern. My one criticism was that we didn't have enough colors to work with. We only had four. Yeah. You could have developed multiple skins, really. I know. I know. More colors. Oh, wow. What did you guys think about the roles? They were good. Yeah, it's fun. Kind of fun. Yeah. It was. I think it was pretty clever because we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time. True. Kind of filled in the gaps enough. The same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up. Do you know, just kind of. Do I just feel like the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day? Yeah. Maybe it's just me, but I didn't actually get any information. That's presentation at all. That's true. I got this. I didn't even get email. Like that was it. So yeah, I feel like that was slightly lacking, but then, you know, fill in the blanks on your own level of creativity up. Well, I think that was, I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to. What to do. Well, no, but also, yeah, when I was reporting about what each of us was doing as often confused as to what you were doing. That was a good much. And then I also felt like, you know, a lot of our discussion would center around specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface version, which is what the whole project was about. Very much so. But and then in the end, I think our job's kind of melted together. Yeah. That was from the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the PowerPoint slides already put together. We didn't have that. There's no way we could have got all that done in time. Very much so. Cool. I think your leadership was quite good. It was. She said, she actually made a comment off on the boy you're getting into this. And I really, I think it's true. I did get it. I felt like I got way too into it. That's kind of a good thing though. I feel like I slept in a lot. You know, the rest of us in the structure work with. So hey. So is that the first time you're taking on that kind of role? I mean, I've never done anything like project management. I use the organized crap. It's one thing to do, you know, set up a party with your friends. Yeah. You know, a little second. But you guys felt that you could keep the suspension of disbelief kind of like the role in the. Yeah. Except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all flying to our teeth. I had to admit, as soon as we started, I mean as soon as we got the play-doh. I can only imagine. You know, the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe like us, you know. Like us to like make a remote control or a spaceship, which is a spaceship like us. Do you guys ever used to build a spaceship like us? Yeah. Still have been in those. Totally. Best spaceships ever. You guys felt like there's enough teamwork in all. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. No, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I was just. No, we didn't actually, I mean other than minor discussion at meetings, there wasn't except for the actual building. Yeah. But I feel like if this was a team project, there actually would have been much more of the collaborative brainstorming to use the board. Well, and this would have been six months worth of work, not like three hours worth of meetings. I mean, I think had the issue being more serious, we probably would have brainstormed more during our meetings. That's true. Yeah. Of course, I'm unconscious of the idea of the project manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team. Yeah. That is kind of. Yeah. Interesting. It's kind of fascinating with it. I mean, the whole process is. I don't know why, is there anything about the way that we got so much commitment? What was the campus from going to the board? I don't know. I don't know if there was a right. Mine was the mics. I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires. I was afraid of the brakes. That's it. The mics are loose and you send me get up. It's a possibility of tripping over something like, contangle there. Well, I don't know what I would have shown on that board. True. But it didn't even occur to me as an option. I mean, I don't know that I would have, but I know that I consciously didn't. I mean, it's just like the paper. I don't know what I really need the paper for. True. Because I've got this laptop. Yeah. Send it. I just use it because it's literally right in front of me. I want to see the output files from the digital paper. I know. My handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap. Yeah. I mean, see what it looks like in PDF format or something. Usually I would do a lot more doing too, but I did. I know. I felt like I needed to be professional. So I didn't like to roll my paper and stuff. Okay. Well, not entirely. But still. I do have less than I usually do. I'm curious about what the debriefing is going to be like. You know, like what is the, uh, what exactly we're looking for here. So is this all I need to go through? I don't know. I'm not sure what the new idea is found. It is about ideas. Did it just say in the email that we needed to discuss? Well, that's the thing I got in the email. I got this PowerPoint file, but this slide was. That slide was like that. I didn't change this one at all. Wow. I guess one the right track. Yeah. Any new ideas with regard to. We're not control concepts now. I kind of like. I think they still do their job. Yeah, you're fine. I am thinking outside the little square box, though. It's literally in like form. Yeah, maybe a circle would be all right. Yeah. Different. This is going to make you wonder. I mean, how much can you do with remote control? It's like inventing a new car. Yeah, yeah, you got to be technically car shaped and won't fit on the road. Yeah. Don't know. Okay. I know. I'll be back into. I don't know. Okay. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm talking to. I don't know. I think this is. Oh, how long was I mean, supposed to be? How much time? 40ish. I wish it go on a bit. Yeah, about the project you've out. I don't know, but you guys, but I felt like. A bit. Understimulated on the whole thing. Like what? Like, you know, what am I really doing? You know, what is. Yeah. At the beginning, it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple. Yeah. And I was like, had like all these brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like, well, it's just another two-minute presentation that you guys don't really care about. I knew I was there. Well, hey. I think it was the real. You know what I mean? Like, we also knew when we were headed with it so it didn't feel. Definitely when it mattered anymore. When I first filled out the question I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to, how much I stressed over it. And by the time I got to the last one, it was like, what I worked. Yeah. I think it was also a realization of basically just copying and pasting what's given to you and to you. Yeah. Which wasn't so clear to me at the beginning. I actually didn't do that at all though. Every single one of the presentations I either added slides or added them. Oh, I added like five slides. I only got one. I just got blank ones. What? Really? My slides were all like they'd have a title maybe. Yeah, my name was just empty. Me too. I didn't have, they didn't like mine. Yeah, they didn't come like this. Like this was what it looks like. Like with those board already on it. Literally just like that. And. What's why yours always looked so more complicated. I just needed slides. I think I added a slide one time. I added many slides every time. Hey, what the whole new background. That was pretty cool. That was class. Highlight. Expand. You're the same. You're the same. Any other thoughts come to mind. I want to know how our products were there. I think it would fail. I think it would take a stretch. Especially for words like that. Okay, an apple would have read it but not. Even I was skeptical. But you know the whole. Even you. We kind of designed it to look a little bit like face. Here but it's happy face. Actually that looked a lot more like a ton. It's previous to. Bill other design modifications. I hope you appreciate the incorporation of some tinfoil from a random pick. Yeah, we can see them. By accident. Interesting. What an interesting day. All right, yeah. Say so. So again, I reiterate my. Question of how different we are compared to the other groups especially between culture groups. I know. And now. It seems like everything flowed pretty logically. from the basics to the concept. Although the whole concept thing, the whole concept's phase. I don't think I really understood like the concept. Well, the idea, okay, connoction of... Functional items. Yeah, I mean, it's like I have a concept of a mug's material. It's just maybe that's what it is. Yeah. You know, maybe rather than concepts, it should be thought of, I thought of it, I thought of rather than in terms of concepts, I thought of it in terms of like... Proposed idea. And then the final would be like the actual specified prototype or whatever. I don't know. Funnels, can I just say? So we have more slides, right? No, just this closing one. I mean, the established that the cost weren't really within budget, but we could... We got it today. We did the project evaluation based on... But Sarah's evaluation of... Connoction of those... There was really technically an evaluation of the product, not the project in general. Which I'm not sure is the same thing at the time that just made more sense, but I could see if they were really asking about us. Yeah. Because we did, we had a fight, think about it. Yeah. And it's all recorded, right? And what I'm gonna put, I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end, so I'll put all that into the final report as well, or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff, like because and... Yeah, and so forth, but up with most of it, and then reports. Maybe so, hopefully we get a copy of the recording. I've had to done... I've done transcription before, and it's really ridiculous. How many words people say, like just in the middle of their sentences like that, that mean nothing. There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that, psycho-ingusics. What the other... There's guys sitting here, yeah, he's studying hundreds of laws or something. Yeah, they're called disfluencies. Disfluencies. That's a good word for it. Yeah, we like our fancy phrases, and we're all just... Just add some prefixes, sounds classier. Exactly. I will save this into the... Pollyger. I find myself hitting the send and receive, but none of you know a lot. I can politely... Yeah, I know. It's like something. Come on, give me some information. Well, to be fair, we're all hooked on the internet. Yeah. So, I mean, we are addicts. That's scary, yeah. It is scary. I'll just throw on that either. I know, imagine, we went the first 15 years of our lives without the internet. It's only the last 10 that were like, what was the internet? I mean, just in the past five, we've gone from 288 modems to broadband all the time. I think we've had internet for like 18 years. No, we have, but not in the sense that it's so... Yeah, but it's not right now. My grandparents had an 80s, and I got it in 94, but still. It's crazy. So, in the 80s? My grandfather does computer science back in the States, and so they had an EDU and Gov network. There's basically the fundamental structures, but it wasn't Household Household yet, because it hadn't been... Yeah, it was to the like seven universities or something. Yeah, that was him. You guys ready to celebrate? Yeah, that's how I asked it. Is that include like, campaign or something exciting? Should. I think so. Probably call that meeting too, and end. I think that's closer. Cool. It's been 40 minutes for him. Because it's been long enough. Celebrate. Where you find that? I have no idea. Is that the only song you have? There's another one. This is where those media players... Huh? Yeah, that's awesome. The default track. I thought it was David Burns looking to the eyeball. That's when it seems to be shipping with it. I haven't really shipped it for a while. Maybe this is a new version. So is that a close? Yeah, I guess we'll call it a better. Okay, the end of the meeting. Fab. Thank you, gentlemen. Yeah, feel good.",

        "transcript": " Let's do it. So to start writing on here, do you have to start by pressing anything on this page? Okay. Well, I filled a buzz. Me too. That's cool. Okay. Hi everybody. Welcome to our kickoff meeting for our new product that we're going to be designing. I'm Mandy and I'm the project manager and I know all your names again. Courtney. Yep. Vanilla and Amber. Alright. Okay. So first, let's go through this PowerPoint. I wonder what button I press. Let's do it on our own. Yeah. Or how about I just click? Okay. Here's our agenda for this meeting. We're going to start with our opening which was our introductions. We're going to get to know each other a little bit better. Tool training. We're going to, I guess, figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles. We're going to make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting. Okay. Here's our project. We're going to make a new remote control that's original, trendy and also user-friendly. And how we're going to do it is each of us is going to discuss the functional design first. How is it going to be used? What's the actual goal here? It has to operate the TV bubble, and we're going to do individual work on that and then meet the same thing with conceptual design, just the base overview of the project. And then we're going to do individual work. That's pretty much the whole process for today. And then the detailed design, just more in depth, get the actual schematics of the remote. Okay. All right. First, we're going to start off by using our tools. And the whiteboard thing, do you guys want to give that a try even though the ink wasn't working? Or do you want to do it on here? I think we should forego the whiteboards since we can't actually see what we're writing on here. All right. Let's go forward then. Right now, so we're all going to draw our favorite animal and then sum up our favorite characteristics of that animal, even if you're not a good drawer like me. All right. So let's do the Greenboard thing. I draw like I'm in grade five. So do I. Okay, about one more minute. About one more minute. Okay, and who would like to start us off? I'll go. This is my picture. I drew fish. I like fish because you know they're a whole water vascular system thing. It's pretty cool and they've got a pretty good habitat and they're pretty sometimes, sometimes fishes, but that's okay. Only for piranhas. Yeah, they're easy, you know. Yeah, right. He wants to go next. I'll go. I drew a kitty. It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat. No, I love cats. Yeah, it does look like a cat. I love cats because they're independent. They pretty much know what they want. They get it. They move on. I love cats too. I'm a cat person. I'm allergic to cats. I'm allergic to cats too. Yeah, if you're around when I had a roommate, he was allergic, but if she was around my cat forever, she became used to. Yeah, if you're around the phone pretty tight. I still can't sleep with him in my room. Oh, yeah, this summer I live with cats. It's crazy. Okay. I drew a badger. Cool. I drew a badger. Yeah. Good choice. Why badger? I don't know. They're grumpy and nocturnal. Are you trying to suggest something? Well, a little bit like the... And then, she knew when to do a badger. Oh, okay. Yeah. And then, I don't know if you know Brian Jock. He's a little puddling rider. Right. Sounded us from like, a red wall, that kind of looks badger-school. Okay. And I'm last. Okay, look at my sad sad giraffe. That looks good. No, no, no. It ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur, but whatever. I don't know even much about giraffes, but I just love the way they look. They're just such odd creatures, you know? I like that they're so unique and individual. I don't know much about their behavior or anything, though. I've seen a couple of ways to do. Yeah, you can like the way they look. Okay. All right. I guess we're getting straight back into business here. The selling price for our remote is going to be 25 euro. And our profit aim is 50 million euro. We're going to make this an international product marketed in the states, in Europe, in Asia. And our production costs to make that profit is going to be a max of 1250 euro per remote. Okay. So we're going to talk for a little while. Here are some topics that we might be able to discuss. Our experiences with remote controls are first ideas about this new remote. Anything that you can bring to the table for this project. So. Yeah. You want to start us off? Anybody have anything to offer? Well, we want to make a multifunctional remote, right? Right. One remote for everything. Great. Everything is getting. We have what sound system, TV, DVD, VHS. I think they'll be facing VHS-O, TV. But it's still there, so. Okay. We're going to do it. It needs to be compatible because universal remote controls are never universal. They're never universal. That's right. Especially if you buy a not big product DVD player, say, usually it doesn't work. So we're going to have to figure out how to cover all the different variances in signals. We need an insanely good instruction booklet because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways. Okay. And another thing that I think is important is the design of the product, how it feels in your hand. If it's just flat and kind of boring, those don't, nobody wants to buy those anymore. They want the ergonomic one. They want like the flashy ones. Yeah. So like this keeps on. Let's say one's the biggest ones that look high tech too. But at the same time, I'm so lucky. Right. So that people have something with the curvature, like that matches the curvature of a hand. Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that? Just fast ones. Yeah. That's true. What kind of battery would we want to use? Because battery changing is usually AA. Okay. Do some of them use triple A's though? Yeah, some use triple A's. So double or triple? Yeah. I guess that is. We need to do triple A, we can. But most people usually have double A's around. Okay. Yeah. But that has to do with the size of it too. Well, as long as we know that issue is, you know, if we wanted to be more thin, then we'd probably want to go with a triple A. Could you go with a small lithium battery? It's okay. We don't have to decide about it now just as long as we remember battery type and size is important. Okay. Anything else? All right. Move the load. Oh, we're closing the meeting. Next meeting is going to start in 30 minutes. Here's what we're going to do. The ID, which is who? Okay. You're going to think about the working design. What do you think of it? Okay. And you ID. The technical functions design. Making sure it does everything that we need, the functionality of it, operating all those different things. Okay. And the marketing person, Courtney, is going to do the user requirements specification. I guess that means specifying what exactly the user is going to be looking for. Right? I would think so. Okay. So we're going to get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while. Okay. So does anybody have anything they want to say before closing the meeting? Okay. This meeting is officially over.",

Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And we also need to determine the specific functions of this. Just to get it all out on paper. So we said it needs to send messages to the TV. It needs to change the channel. Turn on and off. Just basic simple stuff like this. And we'll add it to my meeting minutes. Most channel. On-off button volume. And channel. Yeah. Those are the most important ones. And we want to keep, I'll make a note here that we want to keep the number of buttons down. Correct. Because people only use 10%. Yeah. Okay. Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily? I think so. What do you? Sure. Yeah. So, what do you think, Coach? How are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it? Because people really are looking for our methods. What if we gave it a charger? And on the charger, just like a phone. Like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger. Leave your phone somewhere. You push the button to find it. It finds the phone really go through. Because it's useful for the remote phone. Yeah. Would that add to our cost at all? I wonder. I would think so because you'd have to develop a base. Well, if you have a base, you can start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery. Yeah. Ret headable batteries are cheaper usually. Okay. I think we can make a decision about that later. We need to discuss that. So, that would include battery source. Power source rather. Is it going to have a charger? Or is it going to be run strictly out of batteries? And we also need to deal with the issue that you mentioned of speech recognition. If we want. If we have a speech recognition, then we can start aiming it at another kind of more handicapped disabled demographic. Well, there's the people who desire speech recognition. There's the different demographics have different desires. I don't know if you guys can. You could, it wouldn't copy onto the things it's black. But all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition. So, basically older people don't really care. It's really the people 25 to 35. I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of TV though. They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas. And if we introduce it when they're at this age, they're going to probably always buy a remote that has. Then do you put voice recognition? Do you put the receiver on the actual television in the bass or in the actual remote? Because then you've already got the remote in the hand. Why are you just going to speak to the remote? Right. Whereas if you just speak and done all and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it. Yeah. Well, and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device too. If we said find remote, locate remote or something. A certain phrase, then it could beep. Just thrown it out there. Yeah. Well. 15 minutes. Okay. Anything else you want to discuss? Well, do we want to include the numbers like 0-3-9? Can we conceive of leaving them out? Wait, on the remote itself? Yeah. Like you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. Well, we definitely need those. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think if you can conceive it's like, well, I don't know. It's just a way of leaving them out. I think people would find that too foreign. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. You definitely know that. Also, remember that in this day and age, we need like a hundred button too. I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like 50. So I couldn't, whenever I got cable, I had to get a new TV. So we can get satellite. Yeah. Yeah. So you get your own remote or digital cable. Yeah. Okay. I guess we're going to discuss the project financing later, making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget. Yeah, because I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment. So I don't forget we need to include the color of our company and the logo. The color being yellow. I'm guessing. I feel like the yellow are too garish. We could just have the logo in yellow or maybe a yellow light for the keys. Oh, like stripes. Oh, yeah, yellow. Yeah. Yellow could be, and it doesn't have to be huge. Yeah. Well, if you have like a, you have sort of strip kind of down at the bottom. The base of it. It's just like yellow with the RR. Right. So we've simplified. We don't need all those play fast forward rewind. Right. Yeah. No menu buttons. So we've pretty much paired it down to on-off volume, mute, channel up and down. The numbers. Yeah. Can we go back to, I'm going to look really quickly back at those two examples. Yeah. And see if there's anything. Which one is yours? Technical functions. So, yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Audio settings and screen settings. We need those like audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, screen settings like brightness color. Or do we just want that access access from television itself? I think that that's fine just through the TV. I mean, how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff? Well, the other option is sort of like down at the bottom, like farther away. You just have the sort of box in that where it's like the button so you don't use as much, but occasionally you will use. Yeah, because we need to, we definitely need to have buttons for like subtitles and things like that. Because the foreign film market is expanding and stuff. And like on television, like I know living in Los Angeles. It's tons of Spanish network television. And if it has English subtitles, it's definitely helpful. Can we do that off through one button? Something like a menu button that pops up at the menu on the TV that says, you know, audio, video, whatever, language, you know? Right. So, we need up, down inside the side buttons. Well, that's for the menu. You can just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons. That's true. Yeah. The channel's just up and down. Okay, yeah. Something that, such as, yeah, the one, you know, the one over there on the left, the engineering center. Right, right, right. That one. So we just have like add a menu button then for the various things needed. Including the way to make a mission if you have any like settings for voice recognition though. Including the menu. Yep. We've just got an idea for a design. That's pretty good. Anybody have anything else I'd like to bring up in this meeting? I had something but I forgot. Okay. You can get out of here. Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next. All right. After this meeting, we're going to be sent a questionnaire and summary again, which we need to reply to that email. And then we're going to have lunch break. And after lunch, 30 minutes of individual work time. I'm going to put the minutes, I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the product documents folder. If you'd like to review them and I'm going to type up the minutes for this one as well. Here's what we're each going to do. The ID is going to work on the components concept. UID, the user interface concept, and you're going to do some trend watching. Hey, specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. And if anybody has anything they would like to add? No? Okay. Well, this meeting is officially over. Thank you all.",
        "abstract": "The User Interface Designer presented the basic functions of the device and discussed the designs of two existing products, showing an example of the simple design that the group wants to implement. The Marketing Expert presented feedback from users, showing that users want a simple but fancy-looking remote control and that young users want speech recognition. She discussed including only the most basic functions in the interface. The Industrial Designer presented her internal design of the device and discussed the processor chip and the energy sources that will be integrated. She suggested integrating an extra lightbulb that lit up when the remote was communicating with the television. The Project Manager gave the group new requirements for the product design. The group discussed marketing the product to a wide range of customers. They had a discussion about possibly including a locator function and speech recognition. They discussed integrating the company's yellow color and logo into the design, and decreasing the number of buttons in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to prepare the components concept, the User Interface Designer to prepare the interface concept, and the Marketing Expert to prepare a trendwatching report.",
        "actions": "The Industrial Designer will prepare the components concept for the device. The User Interface Designer will prepare the interface concept for the device. The Marketing Expert will prepare a trendwatching report.",
        "decisions": "The remote will feature a smart processor chip to accomodate all of the remote's functions. The remote will feature an extra lightbulb that will light up when the remote is communicating with the television. The interface will contain larger buttons. The device will be marketed to all age groups, and made simple for those with less technical skills. The remote will feature mainly basic functions, such as channel changing and volume adjustments, so that the interface will have less buttons. There will be no buttons for controlling a VCR or other device; the interface will feature only channel and volume up/down buttons, a number pad, and a menu button to access the menu functions on a television. The remote will include the company color and logo in its design. The group will consider including speech recognition and a locator function in the functional design.",

        "transcript": " Both my nerves. Both my nerves. Both my nerves. Both my nerves. Okay. Hi team. Hope you had a good lunch. Okay. We're back for the conceptual design meeting. Let's get started. Okay. Here's the agenda for today's meeting. We're going to open it. And I'm going to keep the minutes as project manager. We're going to have three presentations, one from each of you again. And then we are going to come to decision on their moat control concepts. And then we're going to close it up. And we have 40 minutes again. And just to reiterate, after this meeting, the team will reach a decision on the concepts of their moat control. Okay. Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations. Who would like to go first? Just trying to move mine right now. Okay. Courtney, would you mind starting us off? Yeah. Okay. Go ahead. Transwatching? Yeah. Okay. So, trend watching. Since we do put the fashion electronics, it is kind of important how our product looks. So, I guess we can go ahead and go to the next. So, what they want right now, customers want fancy versus functional. Basically, about 58% of the product that they want, describing the, in order of how much they want, 58% of the decision of what it should look like, fancy versus functional. And then it has to also be technologically innovative and yet easy to use. So, the customer basically is confused. They don't know exactly what they want. They want us to tell them. They want everything. Yes. Exactly. So, we can go next. Okay. So, in Milan and Paris recently, the trends have been showing that clothing, shoes, and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns. So, I don't know if we want to go with that. And also, the spongy feel is in contrast to last year. I don't know really, I mean, I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff. You don't want like a softer touch. I mean, you guys know what I mean? Right. Yeah. But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns, I don't know if we really want to go with that because it is just a trend. Right. So, I think we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months. Right. Because people don't buy a new one. Yeah. I mean, that could just be a spring thing right now. I can address some of that issue, I think, with my presentation. Okay. I'll say. So, design preferences. We need easy to read, like large buttons, clearly labeled. I mean, because we talked about that being a problem. And then also, buttons illuminating upon touch. You said that in your design with the bulb. And that could also tie in with the color scheme. We need the real reaction logo, a color scheme, obviously. That's one of our key goals. We want to promote our product. And I was thinking about different types of designs. And I came up with something actually right here. So, what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone, like this, where we put the buttons around like we put a big on-off button or something else in the middle. I mean, it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down. And then put the numbers around in an old-fashioned dial shape. Because that would appeal to older generation. And, like I said, retro is cool. So, it's classically retro. So, I mean, that's just an idea. You guys like it. Okay. Ready for the next slide? Yep. And that's it. Okay. Okay. Great. Great presentation. Ready? Okay, hang on. See if it's there. Which one is it? I don't know. Interface concepts? No. Interface concepts. Either refresh it or just... Oh, wait. Maybe I didn't put it in there. Hang on. Okay. Mine will always read copy of something rather... Sorry? I copied mine before I sent it in. Oh, okay. Sorry. Hang on. Turn the hood. There we go. Okay. Looking at the interface concept, it's going to be mostly examples of possibilities of... Where we can go with this. If you want to start the next slide, sure. I can't really see it, but there's two possible ways on the left. If you see it on the sides of the remote, you have the sort of scroll down. So you have that option right there. And then also, there's the idea of the base. Sort of like an idea there. And then on the right, you have what's really big trend right now is the iPods becoming really fast thing. And so you have this sort of very, very simplistic menu section with the round buttons. And it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip, but also very sleek and... And very simple, but technologically advanced. So if you want to do that, and we can find a way of sort of like using that idea in or about controlling, sort of... Look into it. But anyway, next. There's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by... By sight. You know, you're in the dark, you don't want it. You're looking at the remote control. And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button, it's a V. And so you're kind of feeling a V like volume up. What it really is is a V and what you think it is is down because the down arrow. And so it's like sort of because you'd probably turn that with the other way up. But then you have... You could either do it by raised type, which could be, you know, if the sort of old fashioned in a way. Either that or just have it by shape, for example. You have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow. And then the round ones you sort of feel by, you know, this second one down, that sort of thing. So it's sort of looking into how we wanted to do it by feel. Okay. Okay. This is sort of an example of going for a certain demographic. This is particularly the gear towards children. That's cute. We move. It's very cute. And we could probably change it to yellow, bright yellow for like the company logo. You have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking. And then the other thing that you'll be able to do is just to be able to be a... You'd program certain channels that only this children will watch. So it's like they're watching the CBVs or something like that. Keeping them away from other channels. So that's like another arrow. These are three examples sort of looking at it. You have the wider section for the main controls there. You can see how many buttons there are. And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons and a simpler design. On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that because it's more for like a DVD function which we're not going to be using. So again it's sort of like just giving you ideas. And then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the RR. Real reaction. And then finally these are like the sort of same examples but also some more. Just possibilities that we can go with. None of them are particularly keen on by the way. But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying well out of this one we like you know the round section or we like the button size on this. Or I like you know the black finish or the silver finish. Right. I have four of those from out. Okay. Ready? That's it. Okay. Great job. Okay my turn. Okay. What's the title? It will be copy of component design. Got it. Yeah. Looks like it. Okay. So basic remote operation runs as follows. Press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit. Chip sends is the connection. Chip produces a more code infrared signal specific to that button. So you press the button and produces a signal that's encoded specifically for that button. Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the TV center which interprets the signal and responds accordingly, changes channel, etc. So that being said, next slide please. Findings which were the required materials for the basic internal construction. So all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed. We need rubber for buttons aluminum for battery contacts. Integrated circuit which consists of a diode transistor, resonator, resistors, and a capacitor, all those basic things that make a circuit function. Fiberglass and think-up or wire to create the actual circuit board itself. And LED which is a light emitting diode. Contact disks for the buttons, plastic for the casing and a power source, whatever power source we've actually determined we want. Next slide please. Thank you. Personal preferences. To save money for the components the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought on mass. If we find another company who can produce the required chips casing LED, any additional materials we decide we require, at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing we should go for it. Next slide please. Just talking to the manufacturing division. They suggested power options, solar cells, hand dynamo and kinetic power so you shake it and increases the power. I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works they have yet to get back to me on that. So next slide please. Suggested casing options. We can offer options for casing such as straight curved, double curved, you know, very specific to the customer. Options for materials, plastic, rubber, titanium wood. I don't think anyone's going to go for wood one because it's amazing. No, it's fundraising. Certain restrictions do apply here though. Latex you can't do solar power with a latex one. So if they want soft squishy rubber they can't have the solar power adoption. Double curved, you can't do titanium. That would be two curvature so it would actually, if the shape of your hand you curve here and you curve here. So you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold. Now if you wanted that you can't do titanium. Suggested functions for the buttons scrolling function could be very beneficial to us. Instead of actual buttons themselves, I think I have one more slide. The manufacturing division also has said that they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip, which we could utilize. Push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip. So depends on what we decide we want to do. In addition to that, if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote, we're going to have to have multiples of each type. Double curved in rubber. Each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options. So we'll have to mix it up, make sure we produce enough of everyone. But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced 5,000, you know, double curved wooden remotes. Oh my god. Well, thank you for those informative presentations. Let's go back to now we have to make some decisions. Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say for sure. And that's just that this new technology that I've developed on the voice recognition. Oh, this is the thing we're talking about earlier. Right. Except it's sort of odd and not exactly sure why they're explaining it in the way they are. There's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit. Or so you would say like good morning coffee maker and it would just blend good morning Joe. But I'm not sure exactly how it's going to work because do you program the Wii program, the responses and the questions. Does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question and can't change it in order for it to be recognized or can it be altered in a certain way or just the actual user program and say channel means this. Yeah, like using the menu to be like enter your name into the screen like on the menu option to that way. So it's got like a limited memory and so you program it. So it's sort of if you like that's kind of what you say. I feel like voice recognition would be. I don't know. It would be too hard to really. I mean, we could do it. But if it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would you know. Well, we are making the chip. So I mean. But I guess we have to look at what our production cost is for the chip itself. And it is a growing trend. The higher technological. Like the I mean just like the more advanced it is. Yeah, better. It'll sell. I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different. I think we'd have to decide on the power options. Maybe. Yeah, we could reduce the cost. Yeah, I'll have the. Okay, that kind of brings us to this. Let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost. Do we want to go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier? Oh, the base. Yeah. The base. The charging base. I don't know what it looks like before. Because there's something really really small. Then it's sort of harder to imagine the base where that was quite a substantial size sort of standing up. Yeah, and we don't have multiple things that it has to control. It just has to control the TV. It's not going to be a huge universal remote. We need to decide. Well, so we can figure out how big it's going to be. Like what exactly what buttons we want. And exactly the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons, we want to be like bigger than this. Yes, I want to still fit in your hands. You still want to something that's comfortable and substantial, but not necessarily full of buttons. This one is really comfortable. Like I like the sides. Whatever it will lose it easier. But if we have the um, the locator that we don't have to worry about that. That's true. So we can make it small if we have like a locating device. We do a voice activated locator though. We're going to be looking at a more substantial chip. So that's the other thing. You know, what are we going to have certain chips that are going to require bigger size and period? Two double A's for the size. But like, you know, if we get more complicated, then it's going to have to be bigger to just accommodate the ship size. Honestly, I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small compact. Right. Yeah. It's either going to be bigger with a base or smaller with a battery like this guy. All right. So what direction do you want to go in? You want to vote? I think if we had a locating device with a small one, I think that seems way more advanced. I'm kind of leaning in the direction. Oh, ways. Kind of bigger. Yeah. And the base. That just seems clunky. Yeah, because I mean, even looking at cell phones right now, those trends, the smaller the hotter it is. Okay. The only problem with that is you forget to take a dirty repocket and go in the wash. Oh, kidding. You know, what happens? Yeah. I had three watches go that way too. Oh, watches. I've never watched the phone roll. That would, wow. That would hurt. Okay. So what kind of material do we want? Well, we have lots of options. I don't think wood is a viable option. Well, what did you say? Go ahead. I was just saying that's titanium. If we're being restricted then. I hope it's going to lead away from that. Yeah, because if it's going to cause this more to produce a chip, titanium would be more expensive. Right. However, what would you recommend? Oh, we only want to sell it for 25 euro, right? Yeah. Because I was thinking if we wanted to get the high end market, then you could produce a few in titanium. We could do that because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more. Oh, we have restricted by this. Well, the original. I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now. I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of. Remotes. If this was a successful remote, we might then produce a higher end version of it. I think. Good plan. Okay, so we want to go for plastic or what would you recommend for materials? Honestly, I'd recommend like since we're going with batteries instead of solar power, I'd recommend maybe a soft latex. Because we could produce, you know how cell phones have those overlays that you can change the color. We could do one that fits in with the trends of the year. So because this year is all fruit, got a lot of us. Why? Who knows? We could do a cherry cover for this year. And then if next year is stripes or solids, you know, okay? So you're talking about like when it leaves our sales from then it's all going to be cherry colored or is it going to be the kind of thing where people come back? Or we could like take it back. They could take back cases. And by the extra case if they wanted, I think it's good to sell basic thing and then sell. So we could do like a hard base plastic. And then we could give the two latex covers to start. Okay. Yeah, because the soft latex definitely is squishy. Well, I mean squishier than like, right? Yeah, right. It's the hard plastic. Okay, and what kind of chip would we need for this guy? How complicated are we going to go with the voice activated? I don't think we should do voice. I think we should just do the recognition for when it's lost. You know, could we talk? Yeah, because that's what type of voice activation would be like a certain term. What would we say? Because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time. Right. Well, we could give it a specific code, you know, remote missing. I see I'm straightingly track due because I know that's definitely going to be big because it's, I don't know, just so high tech. My little sister got her Christmas, she got one of those keyfinders that's like a key ring. And you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work. Yeah, see that would just be your laugh. And it was start going off and her person you couldn't turn it off. Oh, it's okay. And it came highly irritating. Okay, so I think having a key phrase is much better. Okay, all right. But it's not going to be voice activated in the fact that you would say channel up and it would work. Yeah, no, no, no. We don't have to be a finder. Okay. All right. But can your can the department make that would be like a mid class? Um, yeah. Oh, brilliant. Then so we don't actually have to go for. Well, if they've just developed a sample sensor, sample speaker. It's a brand new chip. Why not introduce it in this way? Yeah, okay. And what size batteries? AA, AAA, I think AAA, it'll be lighter too. Can you run off of two more coming up? A little advantageous needed. I think, well, we could do two. We could do one small lithium. Because you know, the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products, right? So they're more widely available now. And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries. They're more expensive now too. But if you only have to replace it every five years. Does it get that? As long as we sell it with it. Well, how about an initial, you get one battery when you buy it. Isn't pretty sure we can get them. We could think about it. We'll come back to it next week. Yeah. All right. Okay. So we've covered that first category. User interface concept. Meaning design. Yeah, what's it going to look like? Okay. I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial. And that the central button could have maybe our logo on it. It might be the four-way scroll too. Yeah, it could be whatever. As long as there's something big in the middle because like the old phones. Yeah. There's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something. My issue with that is if it got too big though. So if you have the circle and the button in the middle, then is it going to get wider than the other? Oh, that's true. Or hands are. And then with the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it. Complete. In the sample ones that you showed us, there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side. Yeah. Which I think if we make it curved like a hand shape. Like if we put the scroll button on the side. Oh, I see. That could be particularly useful. I think so. So scroll buttons on the side and the buttons on the top. But we definitely, if we have scroll thing on the side, we definitely have to have them labeled. Yeah. Like on the side of it down. Of it's just up and down. But is that for volume or channel? Which I don't know. Well, you could do. We have more size. Can we? Yeah. We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then. Yeah. So that otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this. Yeah. Instead of a scroll, you just have the button on the side. Which is on the side. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Any other ideas? What color? Oh, yeah. Latex covers. We have to make sure that the logo always sticks out when we put the latex cover on. So we'll have to like have a little square or something. So they're the logos available. A yellow strip at the bottom with the RR like that. Yeah. So the bottom of it. I think maybe we should do it on a button itself though because people are able to change the covers. I don't know. Maybe the on-off button, something. Some, the menu button. I don't know. But you know, if we're going to put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one. I'm going to have our company logo on them. Every cover. Yeah, I don't think we should do that because that would just be icky. Yeah. So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea. If we want it to be visible. And are all those those ones that you showed where they were silver metallic looking? Yeah. But those are plastic, right? You're not titanium. I kind of like that look. For our base one? Yeah. For the base. Or if we're going for the retro look, I think like a really shiny black would be cool. Yeah. Or like a good gun metal gray. Because that gray could bind to the silver and the black. There you go. Kind of that would gray. I'm just really wary of putting anything on a button. I'm just going to put it on my little wear off. Yeah, buttons were. Well, well then what's the button do and how do you know what the button does? Yes. Just looking at your samples. You just don't ever see the logo on a button if I was on the actual casing. Right. There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front. We want to be visible. We want to be visible. We want to be visible. Yeah. Because if it was only on the back really the only time you're going to see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery. The other option is, if you can see it, it's like if I can find it again. Yeah. It's like the second or last slide. And yours was called interchangeable. Yeah. Is this one? Yeah. There's some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly. Okay, it's the very right one. You see at the bottom it's kind of difficult to see but you have like a sort of division between the bottom like where the logo is. And if we have the replaceable section it's like the top. It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top. So you have that one piece of stays and the rest sort of clips in. Okay. Yes. You're envisioning it. So that stays to stay when you have the logo. And then you have to slip that client clips in and that's a bit of changes. Okay. The only problem is we're using a latex overlay. So I actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons. So I was thinking maybe in stone doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be like a little cut out. Yeah. Yeah. You know, really like a cell phone. It's like the screen. Right. It's always just left open. And so what are we going to do it like right yellow with our. Yeah. Anybody see anything that they liked in? Well, some of those buttons that are blue based. Well, a lot of those buttons are blue based. Well, kind of. And then if we do have them illuminate upon contact, they can illuminate yellow yellow. I like that. Like if we like the one all the way on the left, you can see it on your computer better. Where the button is actually blue, but the number itself is clear or white or whatever. So if you pressed it, it would illuminate yellow. So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch. Oh, and so on. I like the yellow illumination idea. Hey, good. Okay. Any other ideas or thoughts? Yeah, some be fairly in agreement about what we want to do with this project. So let me catch up. Okay. Do we finalize what buttons were including? It was just everything that we said before. I think there will be time for that later. I'm guessing. Okay, well, we're going to wrap this up. Next meeting is going to start in 30 minutes. And here's what we're each of us going to do. The ID is going to do the look and field design, the UID, the user interface design. I think you're going to get a lot of, I mean, the final say on what buttons get put. We'll all talk about it, but I think that's pretty much what you're going to do, right? Yeah. Okay. And you're going to do some product evaluation. Okay, and right now the ID and UID, you two are going to work together on a prototype using modeling clay. Great. Play-to. Yeah. Okay, and you shall be getting an email pretty soon. All right. Thank you for a very productive meeting. Who?",
        "abstract": "The Marketing Expert presented more information on user requirements which showed that users wanted the look of a high-tech device that was still simple to use. She presented the fruit and vegetable fashion trend that the group will integrate into their design. The User Interface Designer presented several ideas for the interface design taken from existing product designs. The Industrial Designer discussed the necessary internal components and presented options for energy sources and materials. The User Interface Designer also presented the sample speaker technology recently developed by the company. The group had a discussion to finalize the prototype features. It was decided that the device will be small with a locator function instead of having a charging stand. Voice recognition will not be included outside of the locator function. It will be covered by interchangeable latex casings. To incorporate the company logo and color, the buttons will be illuminated yellow when pressed and the logo will be displayed through the latex casings. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to build the prototype, with the User Interface Designer deciding which buttons will be included. The Marketing Expert will prepare a prototype evaluation.",

        "transcript": " I want to find out if I'm about work. See, too. Oh. So I... What do you think? Here's the agenda for our last meeting. After the opening, we're going to have a prototype presentation. Then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote. Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process. And then we're going to close it up and we have 40 minutes. Oh, nope. Let's have a prototype presentation. Ready? Sure. You and me. You read that stuff since you read it? Well, since our materials aren't exactly what we're going for, I'm just going to translate what this all means for you. The base is going to be gun metal glider, which is what we've decided that's going to be plastic. Then there's the latex cover, which is what you see as red, because it can be replaceable. We just kind of went with the color. Right. And then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top. And then the bottom of the buttons will be much lighter blue, almost see through. It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light up yellow. And the whole thing lights up if you press any button rather than just that one button, a light up. And then the bottom we have our logo. Bright yellow, sort of designed with the RR, which will actually look like our logo. And then on the side you have the buttons. And there are one button, but they kind of push up and down. Okay. No. It just buttons, right? Yeah. And then, yeah, the buttons. On-off switch will be here. And as you've noticed on our prototype, they've ended up with a curvature, kind of, by concave, sort of thing, except for, you know, can't see underneath the F. So, I'm hoping that when we get to production, we can actually make them like that, because they're very nice to stock. Stick your ring ring. The two squared buttons are to probably least used menu, mute. And then these are the numbers. So our channel and our volume will be on either side. And then the last thing is just that it'll be black, labeling, and pop. Just, what's we do with this? And did you determine the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand? Is it going to be a single or a double? It's a single, single, single. Single sounds good, because it's not big enough to really constitute it at double. It's only actually the size of my hand. Great. Great. I think you did an awesome job. Yeah, I think it's beautiful. It is beautiful. And it's everything that we discussed. Yeah. Good job, you guys. Good job, you guys. That's really good. All right. What's next in our agenda? We're going to discuss the evaluation criteria. And that's with Courtney. Okay. It's a PowerPoint presentation. I don't really know exactly what we should talk about. It's under evaluation. Right. All right. So these are the criteria we're going to ask. Is it easy to use? Is it fashionable? Yeah, I guess we should write these down. So we can reference them. Feel good, meaning what? Like, does it feel good? Physically. Yeah, physically. It's so... That's just for current trends. Right. Because I'm really telling you guys. Yeah, it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it. Yeah. But so we do have removable covers, right? Yes. Yeah, well then that's correct. And so we can... Everybody have that? Are we? Yes, she's got it. Yeah. Okay, so we're using the criteria for a PowerPoint scale. And so we need to discuss how we feel. It falls within this range. So for easy to use. Do we feel it's very easy to use? Are we going to... I say we individually, right? What do you guys... Just orally. Why not? Okay. Okay. Easy to use. I vote six. Wait, that's false. Oh! Two. Okay. I'd say two as well. Yeah, two. Two. So I say, hello. We're great. Okay, fashionable. At the moment? No. No, I mean like no. I think it's very pretty. You're not too. Very chic. I would give it a one. One. I'll give it a two because at the moment it's not looking that way. Well, that's just like... That's a clay. It's a clay type. What do you think? I don't know if that's a lot. I'll give it like three or four. Okay. Okay. So the average is about a two. Yeah, it's a two. Two or three. Two point five. That's okay. Yeah. I'll go along. All the customers we have. Does it feel good? Imagine. Since we obviously don't have that. I feel like... The shape of it actually does. And it's... It is very ergonomically designed. It's going to be curved. Yeah, that's going to be flicker. Yeah. I think it feels good. I think so too. I'll give it a two. Okay. Two. I'll give it a one. What do you say? I'd say two. All right. And average is two. Is it technologically innovative? Oh, sorry. I'm taking a rejabit. Oh, no. It's fine. You're already had it. You're a product manager. Yeah. I mean, does it have a voice... I mean, the phrase recognition on it? Yes. Right. We were able to do it with that kind of... All right. Chip. We could do it with the chip, yes. It wasn't... We had no reflection of it on the prototype. There's no reflection of it on the prototype, yeah. But that's because it's only two dimensions. And we discussed that. Yeah. It's really included. Then, yes. Then I would... Well, it doesn't... What else would it need to be technologically innovative? Well, we don't have the... You know, we can't say channel. It changes the channel. And it doesn't cover anything else in TV. Right. So I'd probably give it a three. Yeah. Okay. The thing is, for just a TV remote, it's very advanced. But it is just a TV remote. Yeah. I'd go for a three or four on that one. So... I'd go for a four. Okay. Let's go for a three point five. Three and a half. All right. And the last criteria... Is it... Squishy and fruity? Well, we've covered that with these. This is what we're trying to do, basically. Yeah. So I'd give it a two. It's capable of being... Oh, it's very capable of being squishy and fruity. And very capable of being squishy and fruity. Okay. And... It's very important. Yeah. Okay. There we go. Okay. Next. Next. So our model, slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie, appears to be winner. And hopefully we'll sell millions. Good job, team. How did you get that in there? What? Slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie. It does. It's... That was good. Thank you very good. All right. I'll go back to this. No. That's it. Oops. Okay. So now we're moving on to finance. Okay. I'm going to show you an Excel spreadsheet. And we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under 1250 euro. If so, we can proceed. If not, we need to go back to the drum board a little bit. Okay. Let me bring that up. Here we go. All right. It's not a hand-on mode. It's powered by battery. Yep. So we give it a two. Number of components you plan to use. Did I just put quantity being one battery or... Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But if it's... Do you want to go for... This is where we need to make the final call. If it's a lithium or you want to go triple A's. Because triple A's we're going to have to do more than one battery. Oh, let's just go for a lithium when you say... Yeah. It's still lithium. I think... We're going to be... People who purchase this are going to be technologically advanced. Right. Yeah. Okay. Down to the electronics section. We're going to need this kind of corrective to do the voice sensor. Yeah. So one of those... It is a single curve. So one of those? Uh... Oh. What's that? Yeah, that's correct. Okay. Down here. It's a little bit more... A little bit more... A little bit more... A little bit more... Okay. Down here, interface type. We're going to have the integrated scroll... Scroll in the... Oh, those are just regular parts. But if that's a push button too right there. Yeah. This? Integrated scroll wheel or push button. We're really having just push button interface. Okay. So we can just go... But will we... Actually we'll need two. Won't we want one for the top and then one for this one for each side? But that just covers the type of button we're having. Because we're not doing a scroll on the side. It's still push button. Like that. 29 means like you have both scrolls and... Push button. Push button. Right. I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here? Like because there's like one interface right here and then... Because it's not going to be on the same plane when you press the button. There's going to have to be additional signals on the sides. So it's going to be an extra one on each side. I don't know. Now I put a... Well, let's just... Who is just... Is that... Two or a word three? Because of one at each side and one on top. Yeah. I mean it's fine because it comes out the same as 29. We'll lessen 29. Okay. And we're going to... Button supplements. The buttons are not... There's special color. Okay. There's special form. I've already dented. Right. And there's special material. Yeah. Hmm. Well, we're in your costs then. And over. And over. And over. 12.5 is our limit. I've got 11.2. So we can go to production. We can go to... I don't know what I just did. Okay. Now we're going to talk about the project process. And whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result. Did we have a lot of room for creativity? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership? Teamwork? And the means, meaning technology that we use to produce our little guy there. And if we found any new ideas. Now, the question is, how do we do this? I think we just discuss it. Discuss, sure. All right. Who would like to go first? I think we got stifled for creativity by the company itself. In restricting, essentially, to use a TV remote initially. Yeah. Oh, that's true. And no internet. Yeah. No, yeah. That's a good point. Because I've forgotten that that was an artisation. Yeah. And how did you feel about the whole process, though? Oh, overall. I mean, I thought we did a good job. We got to choose, basically, a control over minus it being just merely a TV remote. We got to choose what we wanted to do with it. Right. And we got to say over what, how technologically advanced it should be and not so fast, but it's very questionable, which I kind of, more fashionable, but we're like, technology, for me. Yep. That's right. What about the teamwork aspect? How do you guys enjoy making the model, the prototype? I think we did well. Yeah. I think you did. Did you work well together in there? Well, no, there was something. There was scratching and fighting. Oh, my God. And we've all been a pretty congenial team here. I think. I mean, I think you guys, what is it, the survey, annoying or irritating? Irritating. Wow. That's a, it's definitely a strong one. Okay. The means, the whiteboard didn't work. Yeah. I have to knock that one down, come down and I'll answer that. And I'll bring her really, really, to feel strongly about the internet. And it is so much available. The digital page. The digital page. Yeah. Digital page. I really appreciate it, please. Yeah. They're fun. Even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them, but they are awesome. The use of the laptops for receiving everything. Right, laptops are extremely, extremely, sorry. And these things. And then we have a shared network where we can put all of them. Yeah. And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear. Yeah. And big brother. Big brother. Yeah. Okay, we found any new ideas through this process. Um, we are really going to sell this. Ta-da. For something that looks cool and also has what I wanted to do technologically. And that's your right brain taking over wanting the artistic, the fashionable, the hip. You know, if we all just went out and bought useful things, I don't think. That's not what I was talking about. That's why I don't have Max or Apple. It's just because I look at it. I know it's probably very good computer, but I look at it and I'm taking back to elementary school. Because they look the same. They look like they did when I was in elementary school. Yeah, they're pretty. And just like the tourno district school ward only uses Max with their kids. Exactly. So I associate them with like really low tech, really cheap back. Just the Mac font bothers me. Yeah. But I do like iPods. Go for your. Yeah, no, iPods, they want all those words first. Yeah. Well, iPods are now quite trendy. They come in different colors. Exactly. I mean, how many people went out and bought a Nokia phone back when we were like in high school. Just they could get the changeable faceplate. Oh, yeah. Everybody. Okay. Anyway, so that's a fun to you. But my own issue is just like the whole it's for TV only. I was like, who's going to buy a remote just for the TV unless they've lost theirs? Look at it. That is a fact about people. Well, marketing director says, yeah. Fashionable people are buying. I have to actually create the desire for it. Oh, I look for a desire. That's okay. We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met. This will help them find the one. They'll be sexy with it. That's right. We have an Eve type commercial and that's the fig leaf. That'll sell. And so the serpent says, use our remote. Yeah. Okay. We're going to wrap this up now. The costs are within the budget. We evaluated the project. And now we're going to complete the final questionnaire and meeting some right. And then we're going to have a big giant party apparently. Order this. Great. Thank you, team. You did a great job. It was lovely working with you. Good to meet you too. Yay. Thanks to the project leader.",

Let's see. PowerPoint. That's not it. Here we go. This is our kickoff meeting. I think we should all get acquainted. Shall we all introduce ourselves? Hi, I'm Kiyara and the marketing expert. Would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment? Would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about it? I think we'll get around to that. Just introduction. My name is Kiyara and I'm the marketing expert. I forgot. I forgot. I'm the marketing expert. I think we'll get around to that. I forgot to say I'm the project manager but I figured you all need that already. I'm Stephanie and I am the user interface designer. I'm Krista and I'm the industrial designer. Here's our agenda for today. We're going to do some tool training, project plan and discuss. Then close. So our aim is to produce remote control that is original, trendy and user friendly. To do this, we have to... There are certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing. So... Oh, there it is. Functional design, conceptual design and detailed design. So throughout our next couple of meetings, we'll be covering these things. So we're going to try out our whiteboard. If we all draw our favorite animal to sum up the characteristics of that animal. So you want us to draw it and then talk about it or just draw it. Yeah, both of those. Those thoughts? You have to decide to start some of that. Any volunteers? They wouldn't know what they want to draw. I think about it for a second. Does it have to be functional, trendy and user friendly? I don't think so. Okay, I'll draw. Make sure I hold my hand. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. My favorite animal is... Is he? Oops. A dolphin. Yes. It's like playing fiction. I guess it has a fin on top too. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I guess it has a fin on top too. Yeah. Okay. It's my dolphin. So what characteristics do you like about your animal? I like its tail. I think dolphins are really... They're smart and they're cute. And they like swimming. That's cool. They're graceful, yeah, and they're so... Sleek. Yeah, they're sleeping. They look intelligent and I don't know. I guess it's a little like binocular. I'm a man. How intelligent that one looks. Yeah, he doesn't look that smart. I don't know. I think it's cool the... The interaction that... The things that the reasons people seem to like, you know... You know, people are sitting on the beach and being like, oh look, there's dolphins. It's kind of like... But they're, you know, they jump around in the water and they're happy and... They're mammals, but they swim. So nobody else wants to draw their animal. I suppose I can draw an animal. I don't know. Oh, there goes the 10... It's a cat. I don't know. They sleep all day. Easy to draw. Do you want to... I don't know. I have a cat as well. I have a cat as well. But I've got to spell one. I use a spell one. But it's harder to draw. And the pen's writing. Of course. That's right. That's right. It looks good, but anyway. We'll do that. And the main reason is that pretty. I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment and I like the way they run. And I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of study and nice animals. And I like the way they feel sort of under. Under the... I think that's pretty much it. A bit in. These cords. Actually, I haven't thought of anything yet. It's a pig. So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant, strong and furry. What do you think? Yeah? And furry? Yeah. Well, like a cat. Textile. Textile. I love it. Textile. I'm not trying to split it there. You're dragging it. You have a hair. Oh my gosh. This is disastrous. Sorry about that. Okay. Moving on. Our selling price goal is 25 euro. And profit aim is 50 million euro. So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland or in some European country. And we hope to sell this internationally. Sorry, can you just say that what's the...what are our price goals again? Selling price is 25 euro. Profit aim. 50 million euro. How many should we sell them? Any one of my petitions? Two minutes. No. Two minutes. Two minutes. Two minutes. Two minutes. And well, it's a profit. The profit for each is 12,000 euro. It's 12,000 euro. I'll do it for me. This is a profit. So that's a 50%. I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make this slide show. Experience with remote control. So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide. But we would like to see a convenient practical nice remote control. So do we have any initial ideas for how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the buttons that you have? I think one thing is that it should be easy to find. I was thinking that too. I think you should design something that has like a... So you can... Like somehow like... I mean you always know where your TV is. So you should have a call button. I've always wanted that. Yeah. You can push a button to TV. I mean you have it for the portable phone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control. And even I think a little light. Or even a maybe a vibrating thing. I don't know, but because it's usually under the sofa. Yeah. In which case you're going to be... But if it has a sort of signal which isn't under the sun, I don't know if it's expensive. I don't... Yeah, I mean it'd be cool as enough. But like I mean... Just I mean like your phone even just has sound like it can vibrate. It can light up and make noise. I don't know. What if I had something like... Just like a magnet on the back of it. And you could... I mean just to have some place to put it besides like a bass. Yeah. You know like a portable phone has a bass. Yeah. Like just to have a home for it. Yeah. Yeah. Because people just stick it on top of their TV. But the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the TV. Yeah. That's why it's always in the couch. Yeah. I don't know. It seems like that would be hard because you're not going to be lazy anyway. And we should design couches that have the remote control. Yeah, so we're just now couches. Even just to think to attach it to the... You know, if you had a thing, a pretty object to attach to the wall. But that would make it more expensive. But it's only a plastic thing. Yeah. And then something like that. Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose or something? Bigger? Well, it needs to be... Hand. Hand and that. I don't think you need that. Not huge, but... But definitely not. It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it. No, it really can be. Or like a light thing, you know. I don't know. Space ship. Yeah. Or make it mobile so it runs around. It comes. I can't find you. That would be really... I'm sure we could do that for 25 years. I'll help me in the base. Please. Okay. So what do we think this remote control should... Five minutes. Okay. All right. Let's see what we have left. I also think though that... I shouldn't have too many buttons. Because I hate that one. I have too many buttons. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I know it has to have not many functions, but like... I don't know. Just have like 8,000 buttons. You never use half the time. You... What if... Maybe a little fancy, but what if it had like a little screen? So it has less buttons, but it still has all the functions. That would be cool. Like the way a mobile phone does. Yeah. I mean, it just seems like... So you could like... Yeah. Like if you have... I don't know if you have satellite. If you have 100 channels, you can... The way you do on your radio, that you... What do you call it? I don't know. Yeah, but you can program. So you can program like your favorite channels. So like if you had a... Would you have the screen on the thing or would you have it on the tiny transmit in the screen? That's something we could decide. I guess they would go together somehow? I don't know. Because I don't know if it's... I think it's expensive. If you have... If you use the tiny screen, because the tiny is already a screen, then you can sort of have a programming function. Really easy, sort of arrow up and down on the remote. And then use the tiny as a screen. Right. But... I think you can't... I'm kind of sure. Something like not... It's not on the button, but it's telling you what to do. Is that what you mean? Yeah. You see those... You know, people... I think it's like celebrity crooks kind of things. When they have all these things at their house... Their entire house is so electronic. And they have this one master control that... And it's like a handheld that turns on everything sort of control. And it has a screen. And so I think it should be possible to have some kind of screen. It must be expensive though. But like my mobile phones have screened. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. And we have to remember our budget is 12... Yeah. ...1250 for... To actually make the device... Well, I guess it's something that we have to think about. Yeah. And then we have to see how much that would be. Well, some... We can find out probably... Yeah. How it's it. Yeah, and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water... Water resistance. Water resistance. Oh, I was just... But I thought, ah, spot on. Good feel, tactile... Yeah. The tactile feel. Maybe something that doesn't make your hands sweat, Lord. Yeah. That's quite annoying. Maybe just like a simple thing to have a clip on it. Like seeing you clip it to you. Yeah. Like that's another... Yeah. Okay. Oh. We should probably start wrapping up. We've got some initial ideas that we can all look into. And come up with some new ones for the next meeting, which will be in another 30 minutes. Um... So... Yeah. The industrial design... What is it? Yeah. Um, it's going to be looking more into the working design. So I guess you'd be looking at... That's one of the things you discussed about screen. Um, that sort of thing. The... Something... What is the UI? That's me. Yeah, what is it, Sam? Uh, user interface design. So it's going to be... ... more technical. I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical... Like just... The way it looks. The working design is... The structure. Yeah. Yeah. What is technical function? Exactly. I don't know what. Um, I guess you'd have to find out... It says on the email. It does, but I just don't really wrote down what mine worked. Um, it says... What effect should the thing... Should it have? Okay. Yeah, like in working design. Okay. The medium between you and the telly. Yeah, yeah. All right. Now it works. Okay. All right. I'm on task. And the... Emmy, what is this? Marking. Marking. Marking, right. It's working now. So we'll be working on the user requirements. Um... Yeah. Okay. So I guess that wraps it up. I'll see you all in 30 minutes. I just did...",

I'm going to go to the other side. I'm going to go to the other side. I'm going to go to the other side. I'm going to go to the other side. I'm going to go to the other side. I'm going to go to the other side. I'm going to go to the other side. I'm going to go to the other side. I'm going to go to the other side. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So we'll try to zip through this. Since we're short on time, welcome everybody. Hope your sessions went well. So this is our functional design meeting. We're going to consider user needs, technical effects, and the working design of our remote control. I've been taking meetings on the minute, minutes on the meetings. And I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder. So if there's anything you need to refer to, you can find them in there. I'll get the ones up for next time. They're not finished yet. Right. So can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on? Just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share? Thank God. Or discussing this. Sure. Is that an order? No. No, I'm not decided on an order. No, any orders, then. Okay. How do I put this? I'll just put the cable in. Oh, yes. Okay. Is that it? Can you see? Okay. So what happens? It takes a few seconds, I think. You need to. Who's that? No. Sometimes you have to do it. It's like a three-setting cycle. So press it a couple times. Hold down function and then press it. Oh, right. You need to help me. And then press function. Yeah. And F8. Could you just plug it back into hers? Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. The cable might be a little loose. Oh, here we are. Is it up? Okay. In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found, 100 people were testing usability, laboratory through just their habits, and their habits were observed, and questionnaires were given out. The findings, in some cases, are that we were talking about customers and users don't like the way remote controls look. They don't like the way they feel. They don't think they match their operating behavior. And an example is what we were talking about. The buttons. They only use 10% of the buttons. So later on, there's a study of the buttons that they use most. And I think we should design according to these buttons. Easy to lose. And RS, I don't know what RS I means. The person that did the questionnaire, obviously did. I don't know, I'll include. According to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons, I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance. So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection. They're used about 160 times power. And people like to zap a lot, apparently. So this is the order, a channel selection, teletext, volume, and power. The other ones are the settings. And they're used less than 0.8 to 0.5 times power. And this means that I think we could have a button for all the settings. And then just one and then from there, go on to the audio on the screen, either on the remote or on the television. About the screen and speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that. And if we look at the market, people from, well, from 15 to 35 year olds, I don't really know how to describe this. 91 to 76% of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product. While people that are above 35 years old go from 35% to 8%, so people that are 65, for example, wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing. I don't know what the decision to be made is, but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes more are those like teenagers and young professionals. But it's like, we should discuss this together. And that's what I have to say about the matter. Shall I? What do I do? Do I give this to someone else? Yeah, just be a friend of them. Alright, let's skip this. Okay, so now I need to press evade. What is it? Well, function effect. What's function? It's the little blue. It's the function. There it is. It should be good. Okay, this is my presentation about the technical functions design. And I basically just tried to focus on what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user. So I sort of thought about it myself and looked on the internet. And okay, so basically, I think it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user-friendly and fashionable way. So I think things like, you know, keeping buttons together that like close together that are used in the same way. Or maybe that making the same color, keeping the number of buttons the least, you know, to a minimum. And also things like, is it, is it, is it, can you, small enough, large enough, I'm not sure, I guess we would need to do some research about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing. But basically, we need to make sure that it turns on and off the TV. Does it have, like, capacity to change the channels? Does it do, do we need to have like functions for cable or VCR? And then, is it findable? And how do we want to do that? And I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring. I don't know if it's that good. And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those. I mean, I like the one on the right better, just because it does have fewer buttons. But I mean, I think we can sort of think about things like color and, you know, size shapes, that sort of thing to best fit the user. And that concludes my presentation. Okay, we need the little thing. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So this is on the working design, which is sort of the mechanical functions of the remote. And the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting. So I think we need two basic functions, which is just the basic remote functions. The user can input a channel or a volume setting, and it would be outputs in the TV. And also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the TV, and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would be for flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is. So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote input, which would probably be buttons, although we just talked about voice recognition, processor to take the information, something to transmit it to the TV. And we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal, to have an output, like possibly a beep or a vibration. And also you need a sender for location signal, which would probably be a separate thing that we'd have to sell with the remote, and people could stick it on their TV or stick it on their wall. And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works. Power comes from the battery, it goes to the chip, and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb, which would probably be the easiest way to send it to the TV. And then for the location function you would have a sender on the TV, which would output some sort of signal. We could use IR, but we'd probably want to use radio instead. That signal would go to a receiver, the ship would process it, and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up. So my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be a battery for the energy source, that way you wouldn't have to plug it in. A button pad for input. We can purchase a pre-made chip, which will handle all the processing stuff. IR transmitter to communicate to the TV that's just sort of standard. So most TVs have an IR receiver. Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it. And I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself. So that concludes my presentation. Do you know about, like, I don't know, you seem like you know about, yeah, I was an engineer. Okay. Okay. Cool. Okay. Well, thank you everybody. We have, we'll discuss that in a minute. I just want to mention some new project requirements that came in. Teletext is apparently outdated. So due to internet popularity. So that's off the list. Also, our remote should be used only for television. No, extra internet, kind of fancy things, just through it and the television. And also, we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this. So the phases we put fashion and electronics. So it's be fashionable, I guess. If we have something, I mean silver and gold or yellow or color. So if we have like a kind of silver one, like you saw, and yellow, right? So I don't like that. Okay. So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions. Yeah. Dude, let's, I guess we should, yeah, make some kind of brainstorming terms of how it looks or like what it does. Well, probably our target group and how it's going to appeal to our target group in, I don't know, this, the buttons and what it does. Yeah. That sort of thing. So it's our target group. And people, so do you want to go ahead and design this thing with the finder button? So I think about the things that, yeah. Okay. So the puzzle, yeah, yeah. Okay. So then our target age group would be the 19 to 35 range. Yeah, teenagers and young professionals. Well, that's the speech recognition. Oh, well, that's green. I was thinking about that. I mean, speech recognition is really hard to program. And also, if the TV is on, it's making sound and the people on the TV are talking. If somebody says like one, then the TV is going to switch itself to channel one. Yeah. It seems like a silly, yeah. Not sure how you would implement it. I'll just put the button. And if you consider our budget, probably, if you consider our budget to have speech recognition programmed in every single remote, might be a little praising. Yeah. Yeah. So, okay. So are we going to have just some kind of a, like, we'll have the buzzer on the, on the TV itself? Well, you would have to have a button on a TV or on your wall or someplace, but I was thinking since the TV already has power. Yeah. Yeah, you click the button. It's going to send out a signal. I was thinking IR is a line of sight. So unless the remote is like, actually, in front of the TV, it's not going to work. So probably like a radio signal like on the cell phone. Okay. It sends out a signal and then the remote. Here's the signal and so it beeps, probably. Okay. So you need like a separate base for that or like something. It would have to be sold separately because if the sender is on the remote, then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button. Yeah. So do you plug it in the TV, this thing? Yeah, I'd probably just take it on a TV. Okay. So it's now like a two-part thing. Yeah, so it would be a two-part package. Okay. So we get to design that too. Make it fashionable. Okay. So do you think even though we're not talking about speech recognition, our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals? Yeah. Just, yeah. Okay. We should that thing be on the thing to put the... You're talking about a home for it. Yeah. Do you still want to build a little thing next to the tally or hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now? You probably leave that. I mean, I guess one takes care of the other. Okay. So if you can call it, then it can live anywhere. Okay. So you have that button. So is there a light or shall we leave just to have a radio? Oh, one on the TV on the phone. It seems like a beep seemed the most interesting. Yeah. I think that's what the phone is. Yeah. We only need to find your phone. You should have someone call it. It starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out the couch. You can hear it. It starts ringing. Yeah. So I need the other buttons. So we have this. So I mean, the two remotes that you had shown... I don't remember who showed them. Yeah, you needed. I mean, one looked like it was for a VCR type thing and the other looked like just television. I think they're both sort of just like general, they're both general elements. Because that is something we have to decide as whether we want to have VCR capabilities. Does anyone know if VCRs are the same across international? They're not. No. Okay, so you need like a whole different stuff. But DVD probably is. Yeah, other than that region including things. But these days... And if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers, I mean, it's going to be DVD type. Yeah. That's the technology these days. So, okay, let's see if I can... I think still it shouldn't be that hard to type, like just reduce the number of buttons. Yeah. Because if you just have like one menu button that works like with, you know, where you can just kind of scroll through the options. For sure, we need the... I think we can just design the channels. I mean, power is just a button. And it's not used that much. And it's usually that red. And I think it's quite nice to keep it like red. You know, I've seen some remotes there where you just hold one. Like if you hold one down, it's a different color than the other buttons, but that turns it on. So you don't actually have a separate power button. It seems like that would be hard though. I mean, because unless... Am I being confusing? Yeah. Just because I wouldn't... I would probably pick it up and just be like, why is there no other... Besides, you like to be able to go with the power. Yeah. I have the power. Yeah. Okay, so we're definitely not a power button and numbers. Yeah. Or even, I don't know if people like this. But if you want to reduce the number of buttons, instead of having like one to nine, half a sort of... Sort of like a joystick flat. Yeah. Because people... Now the iPods aren't. People seem to like this thing that there's no... You don't have one, two, three, four, five. Yeah. I think that's an interesting idea because it's cool. It's funny. Like, I just... I don't have an iPod, but like, you know, I just started messing around with one of my friends the other AA. And you just sort of... And it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily. Like, it's not that hard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just... And it's one thing, which has everything. Yeah. But do you need a screen then? Do you have to have a screen then? Well, can't tell them... Like, can't you... Yeah. You have the number... You can have the number... Okay. ...but tell you go, about one, two, three, four, five, once you scroll. Okay. So we have this like scrolling sort of button. Is that like an on-a-mouse pad where... Yeah. Kind of. And it's like the same. It's like, the analogy is a mess pad. Like that. And then you do that. Okay. And then you can have... If you actually just want to zap, you can have like a thing... Like that and that, and then it can just be plus and minus. Okay. So like, it's like a little part of the circle that... Yeah. Oh, so it's just a region of the circle that you can... Yeah, click on... Actually, click on it. We could even have four buttons. Like, if that's the mouse, you could have the volume... Yeah. ...and the channel changes just like on that. So volume could be like the top and the bottom. So do you need to... Okay. So it'll be... You have to be able to change the function of it to like... Well, do you mean the function? I mean like, okay. So... I don't know. I guess... Okay. So when you scroll your thumb like around it, it'll... Like, let's say you're going clockwise. That means you're going to go up the channels and then scroll the other way and it'll go down. Yeah. But then... So if you want to switch to the... Do you have to switch to a function where... Like... So either in that mode or you're in the mode where like... It just has like the four... You know, this is channel that way. That's that way and volume is up and down. Yeah, but it knows for some reason. It's just... The iPod note. It's just the iPod note. If it works on the iPod, then it works. Yeah. So you just... Can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want. Well, for the volume, you have to press the middle. Okay. And then go up. Okay. Okay. So you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up. And then it's like holding up. So it's like holding up. But if you... Like, that makes no sense because there's already ones with up and down here that I've seen. And you... Is there an actual button? Or you actually... You're just using the mouse to go up and down. Well, what do you... Like, for the... It's like, how do you press... Right, if you're on the channel, let's say, then you press on the middle. And then if you do that again, the volume goes up. And if you do that, it goes down. But if you want to keep it with volume here and here, I'm pretty sure... Well, I mean, if we are going to use this for channels, right? Yeah. Then you wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow. Like, you could just have... I don't know. You could click and then have it up and down. But I think... I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the other channel. But the only thing is, like, I've had this so expensive. Like, it has to be... Is that part of... Is that what makes me so... Yeah, I don't know. They have so much memory, though. Yeah, I think so. I think it's the... We'll do leave. Yeah. I think it's their capability. I mean, they can hold what? Like, 5,000 followers or something. I'm thinking we could... If we have... I mean, but... And I've had just has that circle... Yeah. You know, you're saying that's really why they're expensive? Yeah. They're like little confused. Yeah. But, like, since it just has this circle thing, you could make it a kind of cool shape. Like, it could be a cool sort of... You know, because it could be circular. Yeah. Or something weird like... Well, it could just be simple instead of being a mess. Because the other thing... I didn't tell you all the presentation. Is that people find that... find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote. Yeah. That's another thing they complained about. Yeah. What other buttons were there? Volume, I would've just said that. So, okay. This is just for TV. It's not for... Or it is, does need to be compatible with... The DVD is simple. You have play, pause. So, how do you know actually... Our new project requirements, I'm not sure if they meant... Oh, use only for television as a not for DVD or just not internet type thing. So, I'll check that and update you on the next... So, like, if we have that... We'll hold off on that. Yeah. But DVD plays, do you usually have the remote? That's true, yeah. I know, I'm not... We're gonna have it all on one, because you want to turn it on. Yeah. Then you want to turn off the volume and then you want to go to the video. So, you'd have to have like... I think you would have to have like a function switch button, you know, somewhere. So, like, you're either on TV, you're on DVD, or you're on VCR, or you're like... Well, the DVD is only like four buttons. Yeah, but I mean, like, to switch the... So, like, to switch the function of the little circle disk, the touchpad. The circle only does... The channel is applicable to DVD, really, because you don't want to... Yeah, but it would... Volume is, and volume is actually controlled on the TVs, so you don't have to switch. But I'm saying, like, does it make sense to have like some kind of a button? So, like, if you're on TV, like, you can switch channels, but then if you're on DVD, then like, the channel button, like, the region of the disk that was for channels is for, like, switching to different tracks, or, you know, to different... I mean, do we need to think about that? Yeah, let's think about it, because we need to wrap up. Okay. So, everyone's going to go finish their questionnaire. Then when we come back after lunch, we'll have 30 minutes of individual work. Yeah, so think about the things we've discussed, and bring some ideas to our next meeting. See you soon. So, I feel like I want to spaceship, but...",

I'm going to put this on the back of the head. Pull! One, two. One. The other nice one. Alright. We're railing something onto Conceptual Design. See if it was me. Excuse me. I'm just review what we did in our last meeting. Under marketing we targeted our audience and yeah, that was generally how helpful that was. We considered some design options with how it should look. We discussed an iPod-like button system which we haven't concluded but we're good. So, if you all have presentations to do, we can see where you've come from our last. Does everyone have presentations? Yes. Thanks. Does anybody like to go first? Sure. So, I've been looking at the components design mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting. So, we need some custom design parts and other parts which are used standard. I assume we'll be custom designing our case, probably a hard plastic or some other material case to protect their own. We'll need to design a circuit board because a circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output. So, we have to design that in time. But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out. Standard parts include the buttons in the wheels, the iPod style wheel. The infrared LED is actually going to be included in the circuit board that comes with it. We need a radio sender and we see if those are standard and we also need a beeper or a buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote. So, we have some material options. We can use rubber, plastic, wood or titanium. I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy. And the rubber case requires rubber buttons. So, if we definitely want plastic buttons we shouldn't have a rubber case. And why not wood? And why not wood? Well, we can use wood. I don't know why we want to. And also we should know that if we want an iPod style wheel button it's going to require a slightly more expensive chip. We can't use the minimal chip. We need the next higher grade which is called regular. I don't think it's much more expensive but it is more expensive. So, that's what I've got on design. Can I do an X because I have to say something about the material? Yeah. Which is quite shocking. Right. I have been searching the current trends both on the web and via fashion watches. And the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion fancy look and feel. Next comes technological technology and the innovations through that. And last thing is the easy to use factor. Fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing. But I suppose that is included in the ease of use. Are fashion watches in Milan and Paris have decided, well, notice that the food and vegetable theme is the... ... is the current trend. And therefore we need to go for that if we want, you know, whatever our motto is. But fashion, we go for fashion. The fashion and electronics. So we want to put the fashion electronics. We need to go for fruit and vegetables. And also go for a spongy feel. So the question of our technology, what is industrial designer, as the material should be limited to... I don't know how spongy can be, should discuss this to get that out of there. How spongy can be achieved. But apparently that's the way to go. I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing. And I prefer fruits to vegetables. But that's just a person looking. And I think people like to have fruit instead of vegetables in that city room. Those are just suggestions. And also we need to decide whether this should be printed. So that still has to do with the material discussion. Should we print the fruit stuff or should the actual remote look like a fruit? And finally again with the spongy. It has to be technologically innovative. So maybe again our industrial designer should look into that or come up with a solution that's better than mine. To summarize, these are the points that need to be touched in order to get a good decision. And hopefully our user interface has more to say about the matter. Thank you for your attention. I guess that's the blue one. Oh, okay. Oh, so that fruit and vegetables thing. I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics. Well, it's a trend in fashion. You're not going to wear your remote control. So, okay, let me get this right. Okay, all right. Here we go. Conceptual user interface. I'm going to try to talk about what kind of how people are actually going to be using this. I podish remote control based on fruit vegetable design. And basically, so this is a touch-based graphical interface system. So people are going to be looking at this little screen. I mean, I assume we're still on the screen idea. We haven't discussed that much. Because if we're going to have to have this, it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the wheel. It seems like you would need a screen. You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song like, you know, that band or whatever. But if you think of your channels, it's, you know, one, two, three. Yeah, but if so is it just, okay, so you're going to have to switch to like DVD and like other things like that. We're actually not having DVD. I was trying to update you on that. But the screen can come up on the telly. Okay, so anyway, we just, we need to, okay, so if we're not going to have a screen, I think I was thinking, so basically it's just going to be a wheel then. I mean, I think you're going to have to have some kind of a... Yeah, like you're going to have to be able to switch to like a mode where you, okay, we're not choosing that. But like choose channel control. Because people aren't going to be able to have like, you know, channels, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. So that people seem to be... You know, but you're going to have to scroll to get channels. So I guess that's what I was thinking. You may need to have some kind of a screen because so that people can go or go back and forth and choose it. Or then again, if you just, I guess I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the TV, like what channel you're on. You just scroll and you can just get to like five or like 12. But I thought I'd actually have one with a wheel on it. Did you show up on the TV? Oh yeah. But what if you have satellite, you have like 200 channels that get to get to the channel. You have to like... But you can quickly see that. But I think a wheel goes through like 100 channels, at least on theirs. Yeah, if you do... So you basically just kind of need to figure out like what kind of, you know, range we need to have on the wheel. And so you're doing this motion to like control the channels. Or like once you stop that, you know, you can like tap for different... I don't even call it different. You know, functions like volume. Or like you can tap just to get to different channels. Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six, you could tap. And then there's also the concern about, you know, how do you get to the menu if you want to change the brightness of your television? Or if you want to, you know, switch around, I don't know, like these different modes, like turn on the timer or like something like that. I mean, with that many options, you'd... I'd think that the screen would be better. I would think so too, like... So I mean, it seems... It does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it, you know, because... But then again, it does make kind of... If the screen's sort of just like an option that like is just there and you're not really using it, that's kind of... It's more expensive going to the design people. Yeah, that's the only thing. You have to get an advanced chip if you want to have a screen in, which is more expensive than a regular chip, which is more expensive than the... Yeah. So then basically it has to have some way to get to a mode on the television where you're doing... You can get to... You know, you can... Like maybe it'll be that central button that like... Then you hit that and then you can... It brings up like the menu on the TV and you can just scroll around to do the timer to do the... Yeah. So it would have all these different options, so changing. But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up. Yeah. Well, we don't want the screen I guess, but... Because it does seem like that would be like incredibly expensive, but... I don't know, and then... So just really all you need is like this little wheel then. And you can control everything. So... Right. What if... I mean, if you're thinking of the design of it now, like the... You know, physical attributes. Yeah. And you just have this, and it's like just a long silver thing or whatever... I mean, are you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing? Or... It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides... I mean, in the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second, and it turns on the TV. So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before? Yeah, yeah, definitely. Like, I think we're looking at something that could be like... Like, even maybe like a... I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld thing. I mean, it needs to be easy to... Somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your... I mean, how do... I'm not really... Like, when I use an iPod, I... And I'm just kind of using my index finger to like control it. Yeah, I've seen some people just kind of like that. Yeah, or your thumb or something. So when we had the wheelie remote control, it was on the top, I think. And you held it like that. Yeah. Yeah. With their buttons on there as well. Yeah, well, it had the wheelie thing, and then it had those 18 different buttons that I don't know what they do. Yeah. So we just used the top part. Yeah, so... But I mean, I think it could be pretty small. Like, I mean, you want it to be large enough that you can... What if you had like a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much? Like, you... So you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that. So the options are there, but they're not interfering with the design and the practicality of it. We can't... You just... Yeah, like maybe something on the side. You can have a little bit of panel flip over. Yeah. But I mean, do you need that if you can get to... You know, so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the TV screen? Yeah, I mean, I guess that's the thing is... That's... I mean, if we can do this, that probably... Yeah. You wouldn't... I don't think you would even need it. Yeah. So... So I guess we have to look into the... Like, the programming, how they actually program these things. Oh, how they make the menu show up on the TV? I mean, you can do it. I mean, it doesn't seem that hard. It's going to be inside the TV and not inside the remote. I mean, I've never bought a remote. It sounds like this remote is going to be purchased separately from the television, which is a little... Well, they usually are. Well, I've never bought a gesture about it. So I don't really know. But I guess that's right. It almost comes to the TV. So... But I mean, I've never had a hard time with my remote, like, bringing up the menu screen if you need to change the date or whatever. And I don't think that should be too hard. Yeah, most of the ones we've had have had the menu button, because it's not like you need to have a button access to change the contrast or something. Yeah, so just didn't come up every day or something. Yeah. Also... So do you need... I don't know. I guess we have to think about it. But I mean, you just basically need the output signal to bring it up. So it doesn't matter. But also, if you have it on the screen, you can actually write everything out, because the problem with buttons is... Like, they have these sort of abbreviations. Yeah. Because you're supposed to stop. You've never got it. Yeah. So... But I mean, if we have the screen, like the iPod screen... On the TV. On the TV, okay. Yeah. So, yeah, I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really cool idea, because it is so obnoxious to have to push those... Like, okay, now you have a little guide out, and I'll get this button twice, right? And it is technologically innovative in a way. So that's just... And it is trendy. The iPods are really hot right now. Did you get that picture on the... Did they provide you with that picture? Yeah, my web research. Yeah. So... What are we going to do about this bunch, the whole thing? Brand driving. Oh, I know. Oh, what is going to say? You said people want spongy. Yeah. One of the material options is a sort of rubber that's not on, like, those stress ball things. Oh, okay. That would be spongy. Yeah. Just nice feel, but I... Yeah, I can... That would be kind of... You know, usually, like, the touchpad things are kind of a hard plastic mouse type thing. I mean, definitely the area you have. What if we had like a spongy sort of like... Stress ball, you kind of feel like... Yeah, I think it could work. Or what if we integrated the... Yeah, what if the whole thing about the fruit of vegetables, we somehow made it tactily, you know, we could tap into that. So, like, it feels like... Well, it's just... It's just a little... It's just a little... It's just a little cover. Yeah. It's a small thing, instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana, which, by the way, particularly fun though, you could just have covers. And then your mobile... It's like a mobile phone thing. Yeah. There was a time when they had all these different covers. Yeah. You could do, like, the computers, where they have, like, the grapefruit apple machine, and they have, like, the blueberry. Like, all the colors were named after fruits. Yeah. You could name it after. And it could... The color can fit to your sitting room. So, if you have red sitting, or you can have strawberry, and then you have the green one, and you have... Yeah. So, what if... Yeah, come on. So, what if... So, what if... Yeah, come on. This is... I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking. If you have, like, that stress-ball material, kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand. So, like, what your feeling is comfortable, and then there's more of a hard plastic thing. Yeah. Where that thing is. Yeah. And if you have a hard plastic thing, you can change either the color or the fruit are vegetable that's on there. Yeah. Is that kind of... Because I'm thinking silver because those are our company colors. Yeah. Unfortunately, I don't have silver. I don't know. I mean, how are you... How are you all envisioning by what we've just... The food back we've just got about the... Maybe a bowl. A bowl. No, a squashy bowl. A relaxing squashy bowl. That's in the shape of a fruit. Well, I see you're thinking... It's where you're thinking of something. You're thinking you changed the hard thing. Yeah. And I'm thinking, how do you change the hard? Would you put a sticker sort of... Does I always think if you have a cover for the squashy bit, like... This is just... Okay. Say that's the squashy bit. Squashy bit. Yeah, I was thinking of getting a cover for... That... See, I always think this... Sorry. I was thinking this bit here would be the cover. And like, that's your actual... Yeah. And like... Well, like the cheese. You can have like cherries and... Yeah. And then... I was thinking of a single ball shape. Yeah. I was thinking of who was like this, because the way you were describing the iPod and the... The roll thingy. It's like it has to be... Yeah. It's almost like your thumb is further up. So if you could squish it lower. Yeah. So it wouldn't be very big. You know, like how big this big, and then you just did up. Yeah, what if the squashy... Oh, so you're saying the squashy parts like detachable. And you can... So maybe one... You know, you can have like the broccoli squishy thing. And then you can have like the banana squishy thing. And you could have your choice, you know. Well, just the... I can't just... Like... Cover. Cover. But... Well, the question is, which ones are easiest to change? And we can just compact our relevant department for that. Yeah. See what the cost is for covering that or covering that. Yeah. For now we can do two prototypes, maybe, and then try and ask you, as well, the best, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. That's nice. So I think it's nice to have a drawing, because it's neat. Well, that's not very neat. Yeah. I mean, I think... And I think the handheld part is definitely... So you could make that... Into the food and vegetable plant. If it's a bit like there's juggling balls, you can change shape according to your... To the way you hold it. Yeah, if it's got sand in it, maybe, or something. It just mumps to your hands. Yeah. So where are the fruit and vegetables now? I guess you'd be either in the color of that plastic base on the front or in the color of the squishy thing underneath. And the rest is the company... The company color silver. It was... Yeah, silver and yellow. It looks like... We could promote the banana one. Yeah. Like... I mean, that's another question where we're going to... Or we should have the logo somewhere on it. Should also fit the box in the squishy thing. Oh, yeah. I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic base. Yeah. And that would... If you're switching out the squishy part, then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off of it. Yeah, I think... It would be interesting to have the squishy bit... The part that you can change into the different trendy vegetables and fruits. But... No, I know. You spend so much time squishing it to your own personal hand. You can get a new one you'd have to do it all over again. Yeah. A bit of... Ultimatically. I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me. But if someone... Components concept. Question mark. Energy. Question mark. Is that you? Yes. So, what do we know about energy? I mean, we're going to use batteries, right? We actually have an option of batteries, solar power and a dynamo, which is something I don't know what it is. Oh, dynamo. It's a bicycle. It's a bicycle mechanism. It's the end... It's like if something moves. Oh, okay. Yeah, the other one was... The other one was a kinetic thing where you basically have to wind it yourself. So, I sort of picked battery. We could have talked about giving a wind up for a dynamo or solar power. But I think solar power is not available in the rubber case anyways. Battery is something. I think it's a little weird, the dynamo with the interesting ring. The fact of dynamo is the moment you move it, it creates energy on its own. What about crypto-nates? It's just like we'll save you from it. It's going to store loads of energy and you don't need to buy a battery. I find it in the market. But we need to buy a cost. Yeah. I don't know, a cost. It has a data to actually... All it said was it gave sort of a relative... Some chips are more expensive than other sort of things. It didn't give me any actual cost. Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though, but in bulk. So, I think it's not much of a problem. Like the chip is probably the most expensive part. What does chip on print mean? For things like remote controls, a stamp-outed chip, calculated to I think. So you can mass produce some pretty cheap. But it's not like a computer, you can't like reprogram or remote controls like stamp-talk to the chip. So, chip on print means like that. Yeah. And case. I guess it's what we've been talking about. I'm thinking of like some tactic. Let's see. Is there anything else we need to talk about? When we move on, you two are going to be playing the Play-Doh. And working on what can fill up the design and user interface design. You're going to be doing product evaluation. So, you'll get more instructions from your personal coach. Cool. See you soon. Does it matter that I end early? It's strange. How early is it? I think it's a pop-up thing.",
        "abstract": "The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer gave her presentation on components and discussed which would have to be custom-made and which were standard. She also discussed the various materials and chips available. The Marketing Expert presented current trends in the market and in fashion. She discussed the current fruits and vegetables trend and the trend toward softer, spongier materials. The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the remote with the group. They discussed including a touch-based graphical user interface but noted that it was unnecessary and costly. They discussed using the menu function on the television instead. The group discussed how the menu function would be programmed. The group then talked about the casing of the device, and decided that there would be a changeable outer casing. They discussed including fruit colors in addition to the company colors. Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material. The group also discussed energy source options and chips. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype and the Marketing Expert to work on the prototype evaluation.",

        "transcript": " In my wallet, I'm sorry. Okay. Hey everybody, welcome to the detailed design meeting. Let's see, our agenda. Last time we discussed the squishy fruitingness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that. I think it looks like we've come up with some ideas. We also talked about materials, videos and what kind of chip would be necessary. For later in the meeting I've done a spreadsheet of production costs. We'll take a look at that and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it. Actually, you guys want to give a prototype presentation? Okay. Well, our design looks something like this. This being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever. There's a button, it serves as the power button if you hold it down. It just tap on it, I think it brings up the menu. The base of the remote control, which has a squishy spongey rubbery feel, is interchangeable so you can change the color according to your living room or whatever. It can change the vegetable. Yeah, it can change the vegetable. It was that broccoli. Yeah, broccoli. So this snaps off and you can put on whatever one you want. This is not to scale because it would have the battery inside it. This is a mango. It's trendy fruit. It's not just ordinary fruits. You don't have orange. You have mango. I guess strawberries, not this trendy one. It's very bright strawberry. So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control. And the people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them because they'll need to switch them up. It's a little bit difficult to make sure that it's hand-holdable and that the user can use it. It's not too big, but we think that this size will be okay. And we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow. And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was design yet actually would be the thing the locator. So the locator is just chipped inside there. Okay, so that's just the beepers also inside there too. So you have to have a button on your... You have to attach the button to the... Yeah, we didn't design that. Yeah, we have that... But it would be cool. It would be cool. It would be cool. It would be cool. It would be cool. Yeah. Hit that... You know, match the hand-set. Get up the broccoli. Mango. Ta-da. Tada. If you want to look in your project documents folder, there's an Excel spreadsheet. The only one that's in there, production costs. And if you open it up, I've just stuck the numbers in. There's a real challenge there. But if I missed anything that we've gone over or if you see something that has changed, I mean, we decided on batteries. And the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button. I said, Uncurved or flat. I think that's what you have there. For the plastic part would be... Flying pressure was a flat mint like one of the square remotes. But it's really not very clear because you've got single curve and double curve. Right. Yeah, I don't know what that means. One side is curved and then the other side is curved. Well, yeah. If we're talking about the area just... I don't know. I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and to see. So what else? There's plastic for that area around the button. And then Rubber would be the squishy like thing, right? And lots of special colors actually. So we'll real... Do you see anything that I've missed? No, I think that's all right. Okay. So that would make our total of 11.9, which is... And less than 12.5, which means we'd be making more of a profit. And if we saw a lot of squishy things... Oh, yeah. Okay. So... What did you work on? I've got a presentation. Okay. All right. What happens is we have to decide whether this whole project we've been working on, actually, meets the standards we were set at the start. Okay. The method is... Well, I've analyzed the user requirements and integrated them to the TransFunding Marketing reports and in our company's strategy marketing. And the findings were that we needed to look in a certain way, feel in a certain way. And this is everything's listed down. Look in a certain way, feel in a certain way. It has to be technologically and overtive. And it has to be easy to use. These are all things we looked at at the start. And criteria that have to be met. We have to use a table. I'll show you that later together to decide whether it meets the standards. And we have, therefore, in total, we have 11 points according to which this should be evaluated. And the quite... Well, basically, the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria. I would like to show you the table we have to use. This is the table. Can you see this here? So, the questions I've given you... Could you write that down? True as one and force is seven. And we'll just go through each point together. Hopefully. I think if each of us gives an opinion, then they can be mixed somehow. I don't know how it works, exactly. Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own? Yeah, it's in the project documents. Is it meeting three minutes? It's called evaluation criteria. And it's under evaluation. The PowerPoint one? Yeah. Okay, cool. So, it was... Yeah, choose one. Choose one and force is seven. Do you want us to discuss this together? Do you want us to do it, soon, dealing? We can do it separately, and then discuss it. Yeah. If that's what people want to do. So, it's actually a scale. One is true. So, these are the questions we're answering. If it's fancy, you put one. If it's really unfancy, it's... If it's somewhere in between, you put four. Yeah, something. Does it feel fancy? It feels like a failure. No. There should already be questions. Should be more. The blood is easy to inside. I'm going to say yes. Yes. Very, very true. I imagine there's somewhere on the front. We have a little case that you still don't know. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. The marker has stopped working. Unless you feel you need it. Right. So 1.1, we're just going to circle. 1. Right. 5. 2. Okay, so do we just start it up and divide it five fours out to the company? I think we should... It's four if you want to do that. Yeah. So 16 sets four. Oh no, that's 13. 1552. Oh, I thought she said that. 1552 is 13 over four for now. There you go. Next. Three. Six. Six. Really? Two. It wasn't cheating. Right. So 1.3 is... So 1 was two and 7 was the false. Yeah. Okay, because you guys really didn't like it. Oh, I thought it was the other way around too. So we do have them about the same thing. Yeah, I was thinking one means no points. Full of 7. I should have cut the table up. I'm glad this came out. I was like, why did you guys design it that way? You made it in it. I thought you guys hated it. Yeah. That's quite funny. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you guys hated it. Yeah. It's quite funny. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, so starting again, 1.1. 1.2. 3.2. Okay, 1.2. 3.2. 1.3. 1.1. 2.1. 2.2. 2.2. I think I missed 2. Wait, is that 2.1? Yeah, I put it down to a point 4. 1.4, 1.5. Okay, so that's, I have 2. That's all the kind of problems. 1.1. Sorry about that. Wait, where did I put 3? 1. That one on my 2. 3.1, is that correct on my slide? Yeah, yeah. 1. 3.1. I have 4. 3.1. 3.2. 3.3. 1. 3.3. 1.2. 4.1. 1.2. 5. 2. 4.2. 3.4. 2.4.3. 2.1. 1.2. Right, so I put 1 on that. Okay, I'll just do the calculations now. If you want to continue. Okay, I'm sorry, this was so tedious. No, no, that's, I think we should look at the ones that, like, where people said 4, where, it looks like we might want to discuss changing and aspect of the remote. Okay, well the worst ones were 3.1. Do it, does everyone have a slide? 3.1. That was material. Slides, uh, material, technologically and overtive. Okay. Do you want to change it? What's the suggestion? Which one is that again? Sorry, 3.1. Yeah, that, it's 3.1 was not that good. 3.1. Does the shape, shape, I think we'll point two. See, I'm having, I'm having trouble imagining that, is it going to be the size, like the, the controller or a picker? What if we just smashed all the vegetables down flat? And like, then if you could hold it in your hand better. I think the base would definitely be larger because some of these are not as easy to hold. But I imagine even if it was bigger, like if it's round and it's big, then you can't get, that's why remote controls are not long because you have that some kind of, so they could all be bananas and cucumbers. But I don't, I personally don't think this is comfortable to sit there. But like if you just squash them flat, like you made it flat. It's, uh, stress ball stuff, they would be pretty squishable. But it's still too big, I think. And would it even resemble fruit that way? Yeah, like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection. Like you could probably do a strawberry still. Yeah, I think the broccoli would be out. You could do a lemon. Although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say like, when you were holding that before, it actually looks good. Yeah, so. And then you put some of that broccoli. Uh, I think I can think of rhubarb. rhubarb. I think it's a scapegoat. I think my broccoli is my favorite actually. It's quite good. I think we need to know. What if the, it was just patterns on like, we chose the shape or that shape could be whatever we wanted. And then it would just be like a design on the rubber. Huh? Like, just the printed, yeah, or color. Yeah, that could work. Yeah, that could work. Or I mean, we could even have fruit like around. Yeah. I don't know. But if we need, I want to incorporate the fruit thing somehow. There might be, I mean, if it, if it, uh, conflicts with the comfort of actually holding, holding me. Yeah, because, yeah, no one wants to hold it with that comfortable, obviously. Like, I don't know, some of them you can kind of think, see is like, like, you could, if it was only this, you know, if it was shaped like that, and it just had that, but it's the problem is you have to attach that, and this has to be detachable. Yeah. So like, maybe that's just too big because the reason the broccoli works is you can kind of hold it like that. Yeah, it's a nice kind of joystick. Yeah. But, yeah, I don't know. I mean, is there some way we could make it this kind of shape? Because like, kind of, We could get that shape, but just have different colors. Yeah, yeah. And like, we would have a shape because we would have a whole lot of fun. Or even like, yeah, like you said, like a joystick, like that. Yeah. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Like, we could do, I'm trying to think of other shape, like fruits that are actually... Like, is that, I think? I mean, that fits the whole round iPod idea. Yeah. And you still have the comfort of holding it like that. And you could, like, if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on. Yeah. But, yeah. But I mean, do we have any other ideas about that? We could... Yeah. And the critical ones came up to be... Yeah, that one... Bataries is an insect, for some reason. Which can be, and they... Bataries are going... Everyone gave that a one or two. In the back? Yeah, they probably be either on the front or the side. The reason I... I didn't give it a one... I think I gave it a three. Because I thought you'd have to, like, unclip... No. No, you could... Imagine there'd be sort of a hatch... Just like any other one. Out on the normal one. Right. So probably be either... No, it can't be in the front, because the IR is right there. But it would be on one side, probably. I think everyone's under three anyway. So, I think it's... Right, there's the only two points. Cool. Well... Yeah, the broccoli... I guess, wins. Yeah, I'd agree with changing the shape. I was just having fun making... ...strawberries and stuff. We were a bit off-task. So... I can't think of any... So we'll have to... Yeah, I don't know. You could make the touchpad in different shapes, but then it kind of redesigns the whole project. But you could do... Like, sort of a no-way people who get used to having the buttons. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. And it would probably cost more to produce. Yeah, that's just that irregular. How about having different colors and watching them having different shapes, Steve? Yeah. Which is why printing might be... ...like, just printing the fruit on... Well, we've done finance evaluation criteria. Production evaluation. So, project evaluation. You want this, and we'll come up. I guess we're supposed to discuss... ...the process of the project and how satisfied. Oh, it's alright. That's a lot, yeah. Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity? Sort of. Sure. Yeah. I did. I mean, fruit and squishiness, like more creative and spontaneous. The prototype making was very creatively stimulating. And I think we've come up with a product that's fun. And it's all the criteria. And how is our leadership and teamwork? I think it was good. We knew what we were doing. It was a very democratic process. Everyone got to contribute. Well, I thought my leadership was crap personally. Well, you told us when it started and then that's all the others. I think you were fine. You're good, Jeff. I'm never going to do a management position. I know that now. Yeah, I thought we were able to do it together. It all sort of blended. Yeah, I think it more than anything. We didn't really have our set roles so much as we just would be like... I don't know. I thought I could just do it. No spats. That was good. And the means for the materials we used, like convenient, were they? Like the pens, the whiteboard. I mean, one not a big span of any Microsoft PowerPointer. Are you a Mac person? No, no, I never touch Macs either. I just use the Unix or the off-market sort of word perfect and all these other things. Which is a little bit about eating some fat and eating. Well, the problem is if you don't... My new computer never has word perfect. I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and install it. So all these documents, I can't use them. But yeah, I mean, I guess it's okay. I felt like... I don't know if it was just my role, but I thought the information that was available to me was kind of just like... Or maybe it was just the idea that we had, but there was kind of... It was kind of like, okay, I don't really think... I don't know what I'm doing here. So I didn't really think it was helpful. So I kind of just made up my own stuff. And I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations. So I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead. But yeah, I don't really like PowerPoint personally. It's kind of stupid. I never use it. Yeah, but... I can't say I found... Everything particularly helpful. Yeah, I didn't really... Yeah. My first video information was like... It was like a child's drawing. I don't know how it really works. The mind was going to be helpful. My stuff was quite helpful. I mean, my problem... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Because my problem was you guys had access to... Like they send you to sites and stuff, right? Yeah. Yeah, I couldn't do that. So I didn't really know what you guys were doing. And when you were talking about it, it was just like... Yeah, that's why I seemed so ignorant when you were explaining things. Yeah, when mine was mostly made up, except when they told me like, you know, Titanium costs more than they were to make a remote control. Yeah, I wanted to. But it must have been quite difficult for them to build the whole system. A whole system, because it was... I can't give you anything comparable to the internet. Yeah, I mean, I think it's interesting how it all went together. Like I had the stuff about how rubber is cheap and you have how people wanted to be spongy and... Yeah. It seems planned, yeah. Yeah, I kind of thought that... I felt like I would go and like try to use my information or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like... I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because I felt like I was off task all the time. But... I mean, we really got into talking about like personal practice talent. Like it wasn't necessarily what was like... We would never have thought of fruit or sponginess, you know? Yeah, yeah. So I had been told that fruit was... But I think that it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same. Oh right, given certain information or... Yeah, like if everyone's given the same input, I don't know. Anyway, what's next? I know, that's not... Would you guys think of the pens that pass this about? They're pretty cool. I'm going to start to write with them. Yeah. And I forgot once or twice to check the box. I'd like to see what it looks like. They're nicer than the pen that I'm using. Because like your stuff actually shows up here rather than having to look at the screen and write. That's even so, I don't know. And new ideas found? That's all very new. Yeah. I think I'd like to... I don't know. I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down, but they're kind of clumsy. I guess I need... I guess I need to go to the left. Can I drop off if you like moved too much? Yeah, I don't know, but they're... I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones. Maybe we are. I don't know. I think... And I think that... Well, this technology... I guess some people must be interested in using it, but I can't imagine finding it anymore useful than like looking at someone's notes or... Well, I actually worked in a company and I had a role and I had to go to meetings. And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video because I missed a meeting. Like, usually I miss meetings deliberately. There's just... It's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting. Like when you're actually in a real meeting in a real company. It's mostly like rehashing old stuff and just sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's really want tasks you already know. It's like there's just really not a lot of information. It's kind of like an excessive... It seems like way overkill. Like if I missed a meeting, I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence. I wouldn't need to have to watch like a two-hour video with a sound and a transcript. I guess it would be... It's gotta be worth it. I'm just mostly curious about what kind of person or like company would really find it useful. I can't really imagine. How about a pita? I don't know. Well, it's anyone want to talk about fruit more while we slow off time? Any other ideas? What was beyond... Are we supposed to... Are we supposed to watch the port? Are we ending? We still have time if they send any other input. I mean, I think we did really well personally, which is why we've gone through this so quickly. Because I mean, we all kind of agree that our product is satisfactory. It fits the budget. It's trendy. It's amazing. I'm a bit different. So I think that's all for today. Okay, I've got to fill in all this stuff. Meeting a chair and maybe a chair. I think I've learned not to bring in play notes meetings. I think it would be a good idea. I'd probably love to get people actually paying attention, especially if they have food. So I guess we're supposed to write final reports. Yes. I don't know. One is eight, nine, eight. Where's that just me?",
        "abstract": "The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed the changeable fruit- and vegetable-shaped covers. They discussed the locator function that will be designed at a later time. The Project Manager discussed the final production cost for the device, which totaled 11.9 Euros. The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype. Each participant rated the prototype according to the original criteria for the project. The group discussed the areas in which the prototype did not meet these goals. The group felt that the changeable fruit and vegetable shapes were uncomfortable to hold. The group decided to make changeable covers in fruit colors and designs and to use one uniform shape. The group discussed their experience on the project. They felt they worked well together and were creative. They complained that the meeting-room materials were difficult to use, and some complained that there was not enough information provided to them. The Project Manager instructed all participants to write a final report at the end of the meeting.",
