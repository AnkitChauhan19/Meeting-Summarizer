 I want to find out if I'm about work. See, too. Oh. So I... What do you think? Here's the agenda for our last meeting. After the opening, we're going to have a prototype presentation. Then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote. Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process. And then we're going to close it up and we have 40 minutes. Oh, nope. Let's have a prototype presentation. Ready? Sure. You and me. You read that stuff since you read it? Well, since our materials aren't exactly what we're going for, I'm just going to translate what this all means for you. The base is going to be gun metal glider, which is what we've decided that's going to be plastic. Then there's the latex cover, which is what you see as red, because it can be replaceable. We just kind of went with the color. Right. And then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top. And then the bottom of the buttons will be much lighter blue, almost see through. It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light up yellow. And the whole thing lights up if you press any button rather than just that one button, a light up. And then the bottom we have our logo. Bright yellow, sort of designed with the RR, which will actually look like our logo. And then on the side you have the buttons. And there are one button, but they kind of push up and down. Okay. No. It just buttons, right? Yeah. And then, yeah, the buttons. On-off switch will be here. And as you've noticed on our prototype, they've ended up with a curvature, kind of, by concave, sort of thing, except for, you know, can't see underneath the F. So, I'm hoping that when we get to production, we can actually make them like that, because they're very nice to stock. Stick your ring ring. The two squared buttons are to probably least used menu, mute. And then these are the numbers. So our channel and our volume will be on either side. And then the last thing is just that it'll be black, labeling, and pop. Just, what's we do with this? And did you determine the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand? Is it going to be a single or a double? It's a single, single, single. Single sounds good, because it's not big enough to really constitute it at double. It's only actually the size of my hand. Great. Great. I think you did an awesome job. Yeah, I think it's beautiful. It is beautiful. And it's everything that we discussed. Yeah. Good job, you guys. Good job, you guys. That's really good. All right. What's next in our agenda? We're going to discuss the evaluation criteria. And that's with Courtney. Okay. It's a PowerPoint presentation. I don't really know exactly what we should talk about. It's under evaluation. Right. All right. So these are the criteria we're going to ask. Is it easy to use? Is it fashionable? Yeah, I guess we should write these down. So we can reference them. Feel good, meaning what? Like, does it feel good? Physically. Yeah, physically. It's so... That's just for current trends. Right. Because I'm really telling you guys. Yeah, it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it. Yeah. But so we do have removable covers, right? Yes. Yeah, well then that's correct. And so we can... Everybody have that? Are we? Yes, she's got it. Yeah. Okay, so we're using the criteria for a PowerPoint scale. And so we need to discuss how we feel. It falls within this range. So for easy to use. Do we feel it's very easy to use? Are we going to... I say we individually, right? What do you guys... Just orally. Why not? Okay. Okay. Easy to use. I vote six. Wait, that's false. Oh! Two. Okay. I'd say two as well. Yeah, two. Two. So I say, hello. We're great. Okay, fashionable. At the moment? No. No, I mean like no. I think it's very pretty. You're not too. Very chic. I would give it a one. One. I'll give it a two because at the moment it's not looking that way. Well, that's just like... That's a clay. It's a clay type. What do you think? I don't know if that's a lot. I'll give it like three or four. Okay. Okay. So the average is about a two. Yeah, it's a two. Two or three. Two point five. That's okay. Yeah. I'll go along. All the customers we have. Does it feel good? Imagine. Since we obviously don't have that. I feel like... The shape of it actually does. And it's... It is very ergonomically designed. It's going to be curved. Yeah, that's going to be flicker. Yeah. I think it feels good. I think so too. I'll give it a two. Okay. Two. I'll give it a one. What do you say? I'd say two. All right. And average is two. Is it technologically innovative? Oh, sorry. I'm taking a rejabit. Oh, no. It's fine. You're already had it. You're a product manager. Yeah. I mean, does it have a voice... I mean, the phrase recognition on it? Yes. Right. We were able to do it with that kind of... All right. Chip. We could do it with the chip, yes. It wasn't... We had no reflection of it on the prototype. There's no reflection of it on the prototype, yeah. But that's because it's only two dimensions. And we discussed that. Yeah. It's really included. Then, yes. Then I would... Well, it doesn't... What else would it need to be technologically innovative? Well, we don't have the... You know, we can't say channel. It changes the channel. And it doesn't cover anything else in TV. Right. So I'd probably give it a three. Yeah. Okay. The thing is, for just a TV remote, it's very advanced. But it is just a TV remote. Yeah. I'd go for a three or four on that one. So... I'd go for a four. Okay. Let's go for a three point five. Three and a half. All right. And the last criteria... Is it... Squishy and fruity? Well, we've covered that with these. This is what we're trying to do, basically. Yeah. So I'd give it a two. It's capable of being... Oh, it's very capable of being squishy and fruity. And very capable of being squishy and fruity. Okay. And... It's very important. Yeah. Okay. There we go. Okay. Next. Next. So our model, slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie, appears to be winner. And hopefully we'll sell millions. Good job, team. How did you get that in there? What? Slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie. It does. It's... That was good. Thank you very good. All right. I'll go back to this. No. That's it. Oops. Okay. So now we're moving on to finance. Okay. I'm going to show you an Excel spreadsheet. And we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under 1250 euro. If so, we can proceed. If not, we need to go back to the drum board a little bit. Okay. Let me bring that up. Here we go. All right. It's not a hand-on mode. It's powered by battery. Yep. So we give it a two. Number of components you plan to use. Did I just put quantity being one battery or... Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But if it's... Do you want to go for... This is where we need to make the final call. If it's a lithium or you want to go triple A's. Because triple A's we're going to have to do more than one battery. Oh, let's just go for a lithium when you say... Yeah. It's still lithium. I think... We're going to be... People who purchase this are going to be technologically advanced. Right. Yeah. Okay. Down to the electronics section. We're going to need this kind of corrective to do the voice sensor. Yeah. So one of those... It is a single curve. So one of those? Uh... Oh. What's that? Yeah, that's correct. Okay. Down here. It's a little bit more... A little bit more... A little bit more... A little bit more... Okay. Down here, interface type. We're going to have the integrated scroll... Scroll in the... Oh, those are just regular parts. But if that's a push button too right there. Yeah. This? Integrated scroll wheel or push button. We're really having just push button interface. Okay. So we can just go... But will we... Actually we'll need two. Won't we want one for the top and then one for this one for each side? But that just covers the type of button we're having. Because we're not doing a scroll on the side. It's still push button. Like that. 29 means like you have both scrolls and... Push button. Push button. Right. I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here? Like because there's like one interface right here and then... Because it's not going to be on the same plane when you press the button. There's going to have to be additional signals on the sides. So it's going to be an extra one on each side. I don't know. Now I put a... Well, let's just... Who is just... Is that... Two or a word three? Because of one at each side and one on top. Yeah. I mean it's fine because it comes out the same as 29. We'll lessen 29. Okay. And we're going to... Button supplements. The buttons are not... There's special color. Okay. There's special form. I've already dented. Right. And there's special material. Yeah. Hmm. Well, we're in your costs then. And over. And over. And over. 12.5 is our limit. I've got 11.2. So we can go to production. We can go to... I don't know what I just did. Okay. Now we're going to talk about the project process. And whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result. Did we have a lot of room for creativity? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership? Teamwork? And the means, meaning technology that we use to produce our little guy there. And if we found any new ideas. Now, the question is, how do we do this? I think we just discuss it. Discuss, sure. All right. Who would like to go first? I think we got stifled for creativity by the company itself. In restricting, essentially, to use a TV remote initially. Yeah. Oh, that's true. And no internet. Yeah. No, yeah. That's a good point. Because I've forgotten that that was an artisation. Yeah. And how did you feel about the whole process, though? Oh, overall. I mean, I thought we did a good job. We got to choose, basically, a control over minus it being just merely a TV remote. We got to choose what we wanted to do with it. Right. And we got to say over what, how technologically advanced it should be and not so fast, but it's very questionable, which I kind of, more fashionable, but we're like, technology, for me. Yep. That's right. What about the teamwork aspect? How do you guys enjoy making the model, the prototype? I think we did well. Yeah. I think you did. Did you work well together in there? Well, no, there was something. There was scratching and fighting. Oh, my God. And we've all been a pretty congenial team here. I think. I mean, I think you guys, what is it, the survey, annoying or irritating? Irritating. Wow. That's a, it's definitely a strong one. Okay. The means, the whiteboard didn't work. Yeah. I have to knock that one down, come down and I'll answer that. And I'll bring her really, really, to feel strongly about the internet. And it is so much available. The digital page. The digital page. Yeah. Digital page. I really appreciate it, please. Yeah. They're fun. Even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them, but they are awesome. The use of the laptops for receiving everything. Right, laptops are extremely, extremely, sorry. And these things. And then we have a shared network where we can put all of them. Yeah. And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear. Yeah. And big brother. Big brother. Yeah. Okay, we found any new ideas through this process. Um, we are really going to sell this. Ta-da. For something that looks cool and also has what I wanted to do technologically. And that's your right brain taking over wanting the artistic, the fashionable, the hip. You know, if we all just went out and bought useful things, I don't think. That's not what I was talking about. That's why I don't have Max or Apple. It's just because I look at it. I know it's probably very good computer, but I look at it and I'm taking back to elementary school. Because they look the same. They look like they did when I was in elementary school. Yeah, they're pretty. And just like the tourno district school ward only uses Max with their kids. Exactly. So I associate them with like really low tech, really cheap back. Just the Mac font bothers me. Yeah. But I do like iPods. Go for your. Yeah, no, iPods, they want all those words first. Yeah. Well, iPods are now quite trendy. They come in different colors. Exactly. I mean, how many people went out and bought a Nokia phone back when we were like in high school. Just they could get the changeable faceplate. Oh, yeah. Everybody. Okay. Anyway, so that's a fun to you. But my own issue is just like the whole it's for TV only. I was like, who's going to buy a remote just for the TV unless they've lost theirs? Look at it. That is a fact about people. Well, marketing director says, yeah. Fashionable people are buying. I have to actually create the desire for it. Oh, I look for a desire. That's okay. We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met. This will help them find the one. They'll be sexy with it. That's right. We have an Eve type commercial and that's the fig leaf. That'll sell. And so the serpent says, use our remote. Yeah. Okay. We're going to wrap this up now. The costs are within the budget. We evaluated the project. And now we're going to complete the final questionnaire and meeting some right. And then we're going to have a big giant party apparently. Order this. Great. Thank you, team. You did a great job. It was lovely working with you. Good to meet you too. Yay. Thanks to the project leader.
