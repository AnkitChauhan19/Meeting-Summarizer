 Okay. Okay. Welcome to our detailed design meeting. I'm pretty excited. Let's start. It's approximately 1540 or something like that. Okay. The agenda, we're going to do an opening and then I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting what we did just fast. Then we'll have the prototype presentation and look at the evaluation criteria. We'll look at the finances and finally do a production evaluation and close. So starting off with the last one, I don't have it here, but we talked about energy. We're going to use a kinetic battery. We want to use a simple chip because we're not going to need a shovel. We're going to need a scroll. We're choosing a latex case in fruity colors that's curved. And we're using push buttons with a supplement of an on-screen menu. Then sounded like we had set eight or nine buttons, including five preset channels. Okay. Let's do the look and field design presentation first. One is those. Right. Well, we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with this one. We have our colors not fixed, but this is the general shape. You hold it either like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand. You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push them with your index finger with your other hand. Or even then there's a whole variety. You can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger. We have the on-off button at the tip. Very visible. Very big. We have our up and down buttons, which are also going to be our channel selectors and we have our little menu button here. If you push, if you're just pushing these normally, they're the menu buttons. If the volume buttons are either if you press select once, they become channel changing buttons. You can press select three times, the menu with the other features and possibly also with your TV channel choices shows up and you have your five presets down here. If people want to grab hold of that and see how it feels in your hand, let's our number one prototype. Do you want to present the potato or shall I peel off the varsity? I'm going to take a little lightning bolt in it. Very cute. I can pull that one. The rompus. The rompus? This one's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's really blue buttons here after adjusting the volume. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. It's really cool. That's basically what it was like when it's in the middle of... Onoff. That would be... One of your channels. Basically... ...stock-on channel zero, that would be... That would turn soft. That would turn soft... Could the middle button of theçœ‹ screen the pattern? That's really it would make it hearts... If you press and held it maybe, you can call it down. Yeah. That would be on. On a possibility. Okay. And then finally we have the Martian or the pair. Either way, it's a bit different. Just a little bit more of a creative feel. You have the on a toggle stem on the top. We have the five preset seats. And then you have all the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional. You have your channel changing volume changing buttons on your menu button right here in the middle. So, perhaps for your consideration as well. Plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up. We figured it could stand up like this on your table if you wanted it to if I made the bottom flat. Sorry, what's the yellow one in the middle? The menu select button. Very interesting. That's my favorite. That's our three kinds of items. Basically, in terms of what the game is, first of all, decide on a form which of the three different types do you want. Very, this type of button there, we want a number of buttons. And then it's a piece of what kind of experience it is. We were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colors, but maybe we're also thinking that you're sort of middle-aged man, for an example, customer, might not want a fruity colored remote. So, maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down, maybe with less contrast on it. If something's still a little bright to make it hard to lose, but... Yes. Now that was one thing that we wrote up over email, I don't know if you picked up your email, but the feature that we considered for it not getting lost. Right. Well, we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email. And we think that each of these are so distinctive, that it's not just like another of these up technology around your house, it's going to be somewhere that it can be seen. So, we're not thinking that it's going to be as critical to our covers or in a couch. It's so sad. Would it be very difficult to just have an external device that taped to your TV that when you press it, a little beep goes off, do you think that would be conceptually possible? I think. Because it feels a nice mouse. It's probably under the safety, and then that has a non-seminant, but that's something that's really good. That's true. I wonder if it's the biggest thing that the thing is, I don't know how many times people have been in service in doing that to go with the device like that. There might be something that you can do in the short of word in the chip to make it make a noise or something, but it would take a lot more development than we have this after. Okay. That's a fair evaluation. Getting lost. We decided not to worry about that for now. Okay, because, well, the designs are very bright, so you're right, they're going to stick out. So, do people have a preference as far as feeling functionality? I feel like this is similar to sort of what already exists, so we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun, even though this is like what you're initially drawn to, just because it's comfortable and not different. I sort of like this one. I don't know why. It's small, but still sort of cute looking. I don't know. But I also like the side buttons on that one. I think that's kind of neat. But I don't know how much any of this has to do with the fashionable, sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on. Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for Anos, so then we would have to do a one for the next one. There we go. That's good. Here. Stick it on. Sure. Why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria, if you want to? Well, to be blunt, I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for. Okay. That was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do. But let me, I have to write something on the whiteboard. Do you need this or just write on the whiteboard? No, I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing. Okay. Because I think it would be redundant. Okay. Oh. It's kind of like a joystick kind of thing. Yeah. Hey. Okay. Maybe a little smaller than that. No, I kind of like it. That's hard to miss. Oh, it does. It's kind of like. It's kind of like. Oh, come. There. It could have a stem like that. Because I do kind of like the stem. Yeah. It almost helps you keep a grip too. Because it goes in between things. Just a thing. I like this one. Okay. Is that what we're doing? We're doing the potato. I like the idea of a bird. I mean, that's really gotten. The simplicity of the buttons down that one. I am worried about like using a menu. It's not like within menus there are sub menus. And so how do you get back to the main menu? Well, on the island, you just, every time you want to go back, you hit the menu button. You're going to get back to the main menu. That is a menu button separate from a select button. Whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button. Okay. You can find the choice if you want to see if this is the right button. Could these be used for going sub menus? Maybe it could be one of those if you press down and hold for two seconds. Then it brings you back one level or something. Okay. Well, as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it. Okay. Okay. So which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our necessities? The yellow we want is that potato? Are we leaning towards the potato? Okay. Well, we can obviously change it after we go through these different ones. So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before. We need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to. So what we sort of want to do is we each need to separately rank each of the following things. And then I'll tabulate in average just to make sure that it doesn't meet that. So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true. And seven being not true at all or false. If the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria. So we can do this one first. First you want to know if it meets the fancy look and feel objective. So like in my opinion, for now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle. So I'm going to say it's like a three. That's just my opinion. Yeah. What is each of you? I kind of think it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or two. Okay. Well, give it the number. Okay. I will give it a one. I don't know if it's creative. I don't know if fancy is the word I would use. I don't know if any of them are fancy. I'd say two because it's a unique. And two. Awesome. All right. And same sort of scale for functionality. Is it functional? I think it's extremely functional. I'm going to give it a one. One. I think it's functional. It's also very pricey. It's under the same. Okay. Functional. I think it'll get everything done. I think it might be a little confusing at first. Well, there's some other responses that we'll address that. Okay. Then I'm going to give it a two. Awesome. Okay. We want to know next if it's technologically innovative. Did you give it functional? Yeah. She said it. Is it technologically innovative? Not really. I mean, not so much because we don't have the LCD screen. We don't have fancy chip. Other than what it looks like, I don't know if it's really... It's a really baddery. It's a really baddery. It's a genetic battery's big one. So... How many people have noticed that though? But we know it's there. And you're going to be like, hey, I have never changed the battery. And if it's made of latex, that whole idea, that's pretty cool. I'll give it a three. Because it... I could have picked a lot of features. I would made it really. Yeah. I would say that it's... Yeah. Like fancy versus creative. It's... It's different. Which is that, you put innovative, I don't know. I'll give it a three. Why? You don't know? It's a terminological. It's not... It's not unique. It's just... It's just... It's just... It's just... It's just... It's just... It's... It's... I could have picked it. I think I'm going to go with four as well. Okay. I really like that. I can have that right now. Next, is it easy to use? Just so you know, easy to learn will be separate. Is it all? Okay. I think it's really easy to use. I'll give it... Not too. I'll give it a one. Pretty hard to mess up. What's the one? I'll say two. All right. We next want to see if it has a spongy quality. And if indeed it's made of latex or rubber. It's spongy all the way. Give it a one. Yeah. I wonder if it bounces when you drop it. Ooh, then you could... It'd be hard to break, hard to lose. Yeah. It'd be less impact. And what do you give it? I'll give it a one. All right. And the next is... Does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables? Well, is it going to be yellow? It might be... Who that's our corporate color is this? That's right. Yeah, corporate color. We didn't keep that in. We might not keep it yellow. Well, if we... I know it would make it a little less... A little more confusing, but if we had all the buttons in black and the design and the outside and yellow, That would be our corporate one. And then we could also have alternative colors. One and more conservative one. Yeah, it's more like a silvery kind of white or something. Yeah. Um, and can we have like an RR inscribed on the bottom or something? Sure. Okay. All right. So I think it's... It was inspired by the potato. Yeah. I think it's kind of mango-y too. Yeah. Oh, man. Okay, I'll give it a one. The mango kind of put me over. That's so much more fun to do. What's everyone's number? One. Oh, it's it. One. All right. And does the design match the appropriate behavior? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use the channel flipping in the volume the most. I think we really took that into account a lot. So I'm going to give it a one. Yeah. Me too. Do you say one, Rose? Yes. Okay. I'm also... We talked earlier about RSI and wanting to prevent any sort of like carpal tunneling kind of thing. Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account? I think I'll give it a two because I almost feel like no matter what you do, something is going to happen. And if it's repetitive movement, it is going to be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing. But I'm worth the rest of my time. I like how it fits in the hand though. I'd go with the two. I'll say two as well because older people that aren't used to like texting, but if I might run a bit, you cry at first. You'll pause it too. All right, awesome. And the ease of learning it. I know you were saying that you were a little bit nervous about that. I don't know. It's sort of a reminding of the iPod. I just got my NICELM at Reddy Instruction Book and I'm doing okay. And I'm not good at learning technology. So I'll give it a two. The menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing. But I think if it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out, but you'll have it afterwards. So I think I'd give it a two, I guess. I think it's a problem that a lot of the master mates do because you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what you've done over. Oh, good point. I think that I've learned it fast. Once you've learned how to use it, I think that you want to give it a four. Okay. I think I'd give it a four too. It's a pretty high learning curve. It'll be easy once you've done it. All right. Also earlier, we had something about losing it. And so now we're not addressing that at all. So we, I think we can kind of say we addressed it with color. Okay. So in terms of not losing it, do you think that on a scale of one to seven, how easy or hard is it to lose? I'm going to give it a four because I think that you can still, in between summer where you can't see it, you're kind of not going to find it. But anywhere else it's going to stand out. I did give it a three. This depends how tidy you are normally. You're give it a four. It's small too. Okay. We also said simplicity. How, how well does it address just being simple? Simple to use or simple on design. I think overall, because we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion. So those are the next few things we're going to look at. Separate from fancy, like that sort of thing. It like wants to be simple, but it's not like totally, totally simple. So I'm going to give it a two. I want to give it a three, I guess. Three. All right. And fashionable. It's totally fashionable. It's hot. I mean, it's a mango. Mom. I mean, how fashionable can you make a road? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together really well. I don't know. I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot or both. I do like the little animation. The toggle on off switch. It's really appealing. Number two. One. And does it meet our demographic need for international appeal? That whole thing. I just said it would serve our audience. I don't see why not. I think as long if we offer in at least three different color arrangements. Yeah. That's good. So I'll give it a two. Yeah. All right. Does anyone have any other features that they think are important that we didn't talk about? Well, we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to have a corporate logo. So let's make sure we keep that in mind that we have that one of our color concepts is corporate and has an RR on it. Well, I think all of us are. And so we're going to do that. So it will address it. Fine. Okay. Now we're going to look at finances. I have an Excel sheet that we're actually going to calculate the costs. So let me add it out of this first. Okay. All right. I know. Okay. Hand dynamo. We're using a kinetic battery, right? We're using a kinetic, yeah. And we're having one per one. Okay. Electronics. Single. Simple. Simple rather. Okay. Case. A double curved. Yeah, that's very curvy. Okay. Yeah, I don't have to get a picture of it. So I don't really know. Our case material supplements. Oops, we just skipped one. We don't need plastic. And no, we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed. But this supplement is the one. I guess it was rubber. It was rubber and special color. Yeah. Three. More than one special color. Yeah, we're using. We're going to need at least two special colors. I don't know what the basic color is. Yeah. Well, but we know that we're having at least three colors. Well, are we talking about on each color combination? Or we know that we'll have yellow and black. Is that two special colors? I don't know. Or is white and black being used more? Or. I guess this is three. You're saying three, three, three? You're right. Maybe the RR will be in color as well. So, yeah. Interface. We're doing push buttons. Yep. And how many buttons do we have? Six. On a five. With a power. Anything else? No. Oh, we don't. Do we want. Or the button in special color special. I didn't get information on. Oh, wait. Oh, buttons. Oh, so. So the case material will just have one color, right? Well, it's. But if we're making multiple varieties of. This is where I'm getting confused. We're saying per unit. Per unit. Okay. So each unit will only have one color. And each. But the cases. Could have up to three. I mean, the buttons could be up to three colors. That's how it's designed there. I like it like that. Okay. Special form. They're all kind of just push button. No, I think they're fine. Special material. We want them rubber as well. Probably, yeah. So. Oh, do I have to do it per button? Do I? No, I don't think so. I think they're all going to be rubber. Is that what it matters? Yeah, because for the whole case material, it's only one. Yeah. I mean, it's two to make it rubber. Okay. Oh, wait. So maybe. 13.7. Uh-oh. Yeah. What can we reduce? Okay, let's have our buttons. I'll be one color. I kind of like the about that would do. It's only going to bring us down to 13.3 anyway. All right. Okay. Are we sure this is double curved? Maybe it's single curved. We have to know idea. Yeah. We have to know idea. I don't know. I didn't get any pictures. Single curved. Why? Well, it's not. Yeah. Okay. It's a kinetic battery that's kind of expensive. But we have a simple chip. Single curve. Case material is rubber and it's a special color. Yeah. But that's important. That is important. Six buttons. How do we get more to have six buttons? What's in you just changed? It was 13 and no it's 15. No, okay. Maybe not. I don't know what just happened. Now it's 12. Oh. 12.5. Hey. So we're okay. I think that. Yeah. Yeah. Ish. Okay. We're all set. Um. Okay. I'm going to have to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. I'm going to change. Um. Say. I say that to our big shuttered boulder. So you know. Um. Okay. Back to Agenda. Um. Are the costs under $1250? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, we are. Let's move on to the project evaluation. Project process. So it's just a fraction of, for example, the room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, the means. And you know, ideas found. So I guess what we're going to talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project, the information we got, and used how we used it. If we were able to, you know, use our creativity with the information. Um. How, how well I guess I let it. Um. The, how well we worked together as a team. Um. The digital pen, the whiteboard. Okay. I felt very creative. I enjoyed making the prototype. I think it would have been successful in that, um, to almost all of the other models for the set of samples. Yeah. I think we could have done even better with a little bit more information, like once a single curve case, how many colors, what do colors count? Uh-huh. Things. But given, given what we had, I think we did, we did really well. Um, I think we worked together pretty well. Yeah. I mean, if I had had more market research, other than the fruits and vegetables, maybe we could have taken that into account. But the fruit is the most stimulated by creativity. I know. I really did. The whole mango idea was crazy. No. I mean, do you think that the pen was a little distracting from what we did? It was a little distracting for me personally. Like, it's heaviness. Like, just being so conscious of turning the pages, I don't know. That was a bit of a distraction. But with the last one, like, I chose not to do a PowerPoint, because I think it made sense to hear, so I like that I had the option to do that. And just to take my own notes and all sorts of things. I think we all made very significant contributions. I don't think anybody dominated it, which I thought was really good. Like, each of us was able to, like, did you have your information? And I tried to facilitate it without, like, taking it over. Yeah. Come in little finished bottles. I think that's funny. You can't. Kind of want one. Can we work at this as the back-go-round? Should we have that somewhere on the packaging? I have a little. Trying to think of a good pun that I could add there, but I know it's like a legit gil. Like the RR, that's going to be etched in. Yes. Hopefully not with just my thinking at one point. But I'm going to use for a little gadget. Oh, thanks to Ian for the design of that one. He's on. Okay. What do we find? New ideas. New ideas. People should really base their own votes on to its eventually votes. Definitely. Or at least be creative enough to think of toggle switches. I, et cetera. I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now. Oh, I'm still excited about them. Can anyone know they existed? I knew you could get watches that had them, like, really quite expensive watches. That just never needed a battery because you're always moving your wrist. But in other things, I think it would be really good. And it, yeah. That's all. Okay, closing. I have to cost you the budget with the project evaluated. And then to find a questionnaire meeting summary. So this is a great product, kids. I think we've created something really interesting and then we have a market for it. Especially if we can produce it at 12.3, which we hope. Make sure your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the final results. Yeah, I do like the Martian remote. If we could choose more than one, that would be my second choice. Oh, that would definitely be my second choice. Although the twat toggle. I'm afraid I would break it. I would break it. I think I would break it. It started because I wanted to have it as a stem. All right. So that's funny. It started as a pair, but then it started looking word-worldly. I'm looking like a penguin. I'm like, oh yeah, we're doing your research. I like that it stands on. Well, maybe I should market it to some remote control company. So our art. Oh, that's awesome. A little thing. Okay. Congratulations. Um... What did you say? Nothing will come up until after our meeting. It's supposed to be over at five. I mean, I've got more master classes. Anybody else want to take a master's class? That's really funny that you got spam in your work. Yeah. But check it out. So like, there are all these links that are going. But all you need to keep in mind your knowledge management. I just want to make sure you do. No, the first time I used something like I didn't realize it was a joke. And I was like, why did she send me that? It's very work relevant. Because people spam a lot. Yeah, definitely. I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website. Here, you can see what the real... You can see the corporate website. You can just see what's on. It's paracet about a ticket for it. Wow. Yeah. It's really deep. Oh, man. It takes a little while. I'm getting excited to load. That thing, the Excel thing is pretty cool. That's how I live Excel. It's one of my favorite programs. It's like inspiration. Basically, I'm going to give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing. You miss out that much. Yeah, my inspiration from last time is the interior of remote control being taken apart by a bit. Talking about circuit ports. I learned a lot actually. I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to. That's almost cool. I got a whole table and everything. I don't have all of those circuits and chips and trans ponders. I wrote it all down because I thought it would be relevant. All the different parts of the inside of a remote control. But then they're like, you don't actually need this. It's like my name was like, would you prefer an LCD screen or multifunction remote control than I didn't have any kind of table? It's awesome. I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report there as well. It's really interesting though. I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing. Yeah. Yeah, a lot of that. Otherwise the technology out today was kind of cool. That was really how it got. Emails. It was a lot of fault. No. Although I don't see how we could have very a lot, at least for me. If I had gotten pictures of the different parts of the case, the different looks of the case, I would have probably drawn them up. Because they weren't voting on anything. I think usually, like, great boards are good. You're crossing ideas or like, if we had a brainstorming period. They would have put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it. That's how you're good. For the only four people, it doesn't really make sense. I had with the PowerPoint that we can all look at. You can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint. And these might have made us more willing to take notes than to write them up here. Because we all needed them separately, kind of in the whiteboards in this room. Because we were all going to be working in different places. If we were all going to stay here all the time, then having the notes up on the whiteboard would have been all right. But everyone needs their own specific notes. Now, when you were creating your prototypes here, did you work together or did you do separate projects? We worked together, but we were like, like, some sort of like different projects. And then we discussed how the body was going to work. Mm-hmm. So, how did you find the key and the key? It was a bit of both, really. We just kind of started out by each taking a color of clay and just pulling around with it. And I came out with that rhombus shape. And he came out with a sort of potato-y mango-y shape. And then, just went from there, really. Cool. That was fun. So, well done with the management. I felt well-managed. Oh, thank you. I think we could well and say that we're just keeping our patience to time. And certainly, actually, we did the good job of making fun decisions. Mm-hmm. Sorry. That happened to be all the time though. I know what happened sometimes is that events have been happening to me. And then, because it took the way without anything that really gave the decided. Mm-hmm. I think, and we got the decisive points now that we can set up the new ways that I want to make it. Yeah, I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting. We didn't really have enough information to make from decisions. Mm-hmm. But we were able to do it regardless, so. I'm not usually a very decisive person, so it helped to help people say this needs to be done to find them. I found that we could have used another five or ten minutes. Especially the last time. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think the last time we had a lot of information, but at the same time, not quite enough. You know what I mean? We couldn't answer every single question. Right. But, and I felt the first two meetings that I was coming in with no information. And that sort of made me really, I don't know, throwing together a PowerPoint out of no information there. And the last time it was like the opposite, I had so much information and so much to talk about. It was interesting what came out later, like as I was doing the, when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me, that more points came out from your presentation even. I'm a little, I am a little disappointed that we didn't do something for losing their amount, because that was kind of a big point. But that was something like in order to talk about that, we would have had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards. That was like, even when we just were creating from the Excel file, there wasn't like an option to select to somehow have it included. So there was no way we could be like, yeah, I haven't included. There's no way for us to have ridden down that it was really there. I think we were just getting over in through the essay with the task. Well, it's interesting really got into it. I mean, I got into it as the day went on. I got really like, oh, I'm designing room of control. I don't know if that's just me, but yeah, it was really. It was interesting though that they put that 50% of people say they have frustration with losing their amount, and yet they didn't provide us with information too. Yeah, I'm trying to discuss that. I know that people have things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep. But I'm sure that would require some kind of technology that I just don't know what it is. I think there are some of those like, intercom or show remote that have things so you won't lose them. I don't know. I mean, we were talking about it in like, in my household at least, there's only about two places that their remote is ever. There's only one TV and there's only like, you never got a place where your keys are. I always do anyway. You'll lose them in your pocket. Like, you just won't forget that, or you'll like put it down somewhere that like made sense. And then, I remember there's always ways to lose things. Yeah, it depends on how organized you are personally. Yeah, or like, I guess what the set of the house is to. But I am notorious for losing my keys. I guess I've just never lost the remote. I put my keys in the refrigerator the other day. But I was putting groceries away. You're taking stuff on the bag and putting them in the refrigerator. In fact, my room can't get in. Yeah, it can. Look all around the kitchen. Definitely in the vegetable drawer. So I always do the alleviate in my coat and like, you as you need a different coat. Yep. I guess it's good we don't really care about it around that much. I can't wait to get into the other room. Maybe it was our little robot when we could have had him have a robot alien pair or whatever he is. Have a little voice. I am located. A GPS. It's an intergal GPS. And then, yeah. I thought if it's sitting still for a minute. We should make one that walks by itself. It really could get up and walk away. Or like some crazy like electro magnet that you push it in your little zoom to the TV and stick there. Or just a wheel, you know. Just if you have to ever vote for your robot. Well, but if you could attach them to the TV. I'll kind of press the button. Okay. Sorry, I'm just trying to update my minutes. I decided to, you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint in minutes will be complimentary. Yeah. Rather than like repeating, I'm just going to make a make full minutes so that it will include all of the agenda. Wow. Because it seems a little more useful. You can't look the most typing and organizing to do. But I didn't have like information to sloth the area there. How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you? Every meeting. Most of it. I added slides. I added a couple of slides each time, but that was about it. I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in. I didn't even think about adding more. Well, the thing was you would provide you an agenda with several points, but it wouldn't have a slide for each point. And that's the only way I remember that I need to go over that point. I know personally when I do PowerPoint, that's what I do. I added ones. Even if it was just like the title of it, like the three presentations. That we didn't write. I'm not going to write it. You have to have a slogan on it. Or can it just be like the slogan on it? No, definitely. It could go around the other side. No, I don't think we need to. Which is art. Especially the yellow and black one. Is it yellow or blue? Or yellow and blue? Let me go to the webpage. Yeah, it's just kind of going by the webpage because they didn't give me any clear. Like yellow, red, gray. It's not going to be this black. Gray. Great. Better than black doesn't look so bumbly to you. I really understand the red and I'm like news clubbing. Finish meeting now. Wasn't it interesting that... I thought it was interesting that our marketing expert did not agree with the marketing choices. I walked through thinking you were doing a really big market evaluation. You wouldn't just have one set of sources. They were so not backed up. It would just be a sentence to be like, we did a survey. This is what people said. Yeah. I don't know. People are stupid. I guess it's sort of like gray isn't it? Yellow and gray but then the slogans and blue. Well, we got some gray and we got some blue buttons. We're good. Yeah. Well, they don't have the right color clay anyway. Maybe it's like... Well, we're not sadly going to actually be producing this. Oh. If they ever come out with potato. Potato bag of a shaper votes. I'm going to have to clean it in intellectual property. Yeah. I can't believe the whole day is done. I don't feel like it's been that long. It's like day.
