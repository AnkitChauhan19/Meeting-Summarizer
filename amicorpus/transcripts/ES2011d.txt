 In my wallet, I'm sorry. Okay. Hey everybody, welcome to the detailed design meeting. Let's see, our agenda. Last time we discussed the squishy fruitingness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that. I think it looks like we've come up with some ideas. We also talked about materials, videos and what kind of chip would be necessary. For later in the meeting I've done a spreadsheet of production costs. We'll take a look at that and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it. Actually, you guys want to give a prototype presentation? Okay. Well, our design looks something like this. This being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever. There's a button, it serves as the power button if you hold it down. It just tap on it, I think it brings up the menu. The base of the remote control, which has a squishy spongey rubbery feel, is interchangeable so you can change the color according to your living room or whatever. It can change the vegetable. Yeah, it can change the vegetable. It was that broccoli. Yeah, broccoli. So this snaps off and you can put on whatever one you want. This is not to scale because it would have the battery inside it. This is a mango. It's trendy fruit. It's not just ordinary fruits. You don't have orange. You have mango. I guess strawberries, not this trendy one. It's very bright strawberry. So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control. And the people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them because they'll need to switch them up. It's a little bit difficult to make sure that it's hand-holdable and that the user can use it. It's not too big, but we think that this size will be okay. And we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow. And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was design yet actually would be the thing the locator. So the locator is just chipped inside there. Okay, so that's just the beepers also inside there too. So you have to have a button on your... You have to attach the button to the... Yeah, we didn't design that. Yeah, we have that... But it would be cool. It would be cool. It would be cool. It would be cool. It would be cool. Yeah. Hit that... You know, match the hand-set. Get up the broccoli. Mango. Ta-da. Tada. If you want to look in your project documents folder, there's an Excel spreadsheet. The only one that's in there, production costs. And if you open it up, I've just stuck the numbers in. There's a real challenge there. But if I missed anything that we've gone over or if you see something that has changed, I mean, we decided on batteries. And the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button. I said, Uncurved or flat. I think that's what you have there. For the plastic part would be... Flying pressure was a flat mint like one of the square remotes. But it's really not very clear because you've got single curve and double curve. Right. Yeah, I don't know what that means. One side is curved and then the other side is curved. Well, yeah. If we're talking about the area just... I don't know. I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and to see. So what else? There's plastic for that area around the button. And then Rubber would be the squishy like thing, right? And lots of special colors actually. So we'll real... Do you see anything that I've missed? No, I think that's all right. Okay. So that would make our total of 11.9, which is... And less than 12.5, which means we'd be making more of a profit. And if we saw a lot of squishy things... Oh, yeah. Okay. So... What did you work on? I've got a presentation. Okay. All right. What happens is we have to decide whether this whole project we've been working on, actually, meets the standards we were set at the start. Okay. The method is... Well, I've analyzed the user requirements and integrated them to the TransFunding Marketing reports and in our company's strategy marketing. And the findings were that we needed to look in a certain way, feel in a certain way. And this is everything's listed down. Look in a certain way, feel in a certain way. It has to be technologically and overtive. And it has to be easy to use. These are all things we looked at at the start. And criteria that have to be met. We have to use a table. I'll show you that later together to decide whether it meets the standards. And we have, therefore, in total, we have 11 points according to which this should be evaluated. And the quite... Well, basically, the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria. I would like to show you the table we have to use. This is the table. Can you see this here? So, the questions I've given you... Could you write that down? True as one and force is seven. And we'll just go through each point together. Hopefully. I think if each of us gives an opinion, then they can be mixed somehow. I don't know how it works, exactly. Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own? Yeah, it's in the project documents. Is it meeting three minutes? It's called evaluation criteria. And it's under evaluation. The PowerPoint one? Yeah. Okay, cool. So, it was... Yeah, choose one. Choose one and force is seven. Do you want us to discuss this together? Do you want us to do it, soon, dealing? We can do it separately, and then discuss it. Yeah. If that's what people want to do. So, it's actually a scale. One is true. So, these are the questions we're answering. If it's fancy, you put one. If it's really unfancy, it's... If it's somewhere in between, you put four. Yeah, something. Does it feel fancy? It feels like a failure. No. There should already be questions. Should be more. The blood is easy to inside. I'm going to say yes. Yes. Very, very true. I imagine there's somewhere on the front. We have a little case that you still don't know. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. I'm going to say yes. The marker has stopped working. Unless you feel you need it. Right. So 1.1, we're just going to circle. 1. Right. 5. 2. Okay, so do we just start it up and divide it five fours out to the company? I think we should... It's four if you want to do that. Yeah. So 16 sets four. Oh no, that's 13. 1552. Oh, I thought she said that. 1552 is 13 over four for now. There you go. Next. Three. Six. Six. Really? Two. It wasn't cheating. Right. So 1.3 is... So 1 was two and 7 was the false. Yeah. Okay, because you guys really didn't like it. Oh, I thought it was the other way around too. So we do have them about the same thing. Yeah, I was thinking one means no points. Full of 7. I should have cut the table up. I'm glad this came out. I was like, why did you guys design it that way? You made it in it. I thought you guys hated it. Yeah. That's quite funny. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you guys hated it. Yeah. It's quite funny. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, okay, so starting again, 1.1. 1.2. 3.2. Okay, 1.2. 3.2. 1.3. 1.1. 2.1. 2.2. 2.2. I think I missed 2. Wait, is that 2.1? Yeah, I put it down to a point 4. 1.4, 1.5. Okay, so that's, I have 2. That's all the kind of problems. 1.1. Sorry about that. Wait, where did I put 3? 1. That one on my 2. 3.1, is that correct on my slide? Yeah, yeah. 1. 3.1. I have 4. 3.1. 3.2. 3.3. 1. 3.3. 1.2. 4.1. 1.2. 5. 2. 4.2. 3.4. 2.4.3. 2.1. 1.2. Right, so I put 1 on that. Okay, I'll just do the calculations now. If you want to continue. Okay, I'm sorry, this was so tedious. No, no, that's, I think we should look at the ones that, like, where people said 4, where, it looks like we might want to discuss changing and aspect of the remote. Okay, well the worst ones were 3.1. Do it, does everyone have a slide? 3.1. That was material. Slides, uh, material, technologically and overtive. Okay. Do you want to change it? What's the suggestion? Which one is that again? Sorry, 3.1. Yeah, that, it's 3.1 was not that good. 3.1. Does the shape, shape, I think we'll point two. See, I'm having, I'm having trouble imagining that, is it going to be the size, like the, the controller or a picker? What if we just smashed all the vegetables down flat? And like, then if you could hold it in your hand better. I think the base would definitely be larger because some of these are not as easy to hold. But I imagine even if it was bigger, like if it's round and it's big, then you can't get, that's why remote controls are not long because you have that some kind of, so they could all be bananas and cucumbers. But I don't, I personally don't think this is comfortable to sit there. But like if you just squash them flat, like you made it flat. It's, uh, stress ball stuff, they would be pretty squishable. But it's still too big, I think. And would it even resemble fruit that way? Yeah, like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection. Like you could probably do a strawberry still. Yeah, I think the broccoli would be out. You could do a lemon. Although the broccoli is quite comfortable, I have to say like, when you were holding that before, it actually looks good. Yeah, so. And then you put some of that broccoli. Uh, I think I can think of rhubarb. rhubarb. I think it's a scapegoat. I think my broccoli is my favorite actually. It's quite good. I think we need to know. What if the, it was just patterns on like, we chose the shape or that shape could be whatever we wanted. And then it would just be like a design on the rubber. Huh? Like, just the printed, yeah, or color. Yeah, that could work. Yeah, that could work. Or I mean, we could even have fruit like around. Yeah. I don't know. But if we need, I want to incorporate the fruit thing somehow. There might be, I mean, if it, if it, uh, conflicts with the comfort of actually holding, holding me. Yeah, because, yeah, no one wants to hold it with that comfortable, obviously. Like, I don't know, some of them you can kind of think, see is like, like, you could, if it was only this, you know, if it was shaped like that, and it just had that, but it's the problem is you have to attach that, and this has to be detachable. Yeah. So like, maybe that's just too big because the reason the broccoli works is you can kind of hold it like that. Yeah, it's a nice kind of joystick. Yeah. But, yeah, I don't know. I mean, is there some way we could make it this kind of shape? Because like, kind of, We could get that shape, but just have different colors. Yeah, yeah. And like, we would have a shape because we would have a whole lot of fun. Or even like, yeah, like you said, like a joystick, like that. Yeah. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Like, we could do, I'm trying to think of other shape, like fruits that are actually... Like, is that, I think? I mean, that fits the whole round iPod idea. Yeah. And you still have the comfort of holding it like that. And you could, like, if it's like this, you could put fruit designs and stuff on. Yeah. But, yeah. But I mean, do we have any other ideas about that? We could... Yeah. And the critical ones came up to be... Yeah, that one... Bataries is an insect, for some reason. Which can be, and they... Bataries are going... Everyone gave that a one or two. In the back? Yeah, they probably be either on the front or the side. The reason I... I didn't give it a one... I think I gave it a three. Because I thought you'd have to, like, unclip... No. No, you could... Imagine there'd be sort of a hatch... Just like any other one. Out on the normal one. Right. So probably be either... No, it can't be in the front, because the IR is right there. But it would be on one side, probably. I think everyone's under three anyway. So, I think it's... Right, there's the only two points. Cool. Well... Yeah, the broccoli... I guess, wins. Yeah, I'd agree with changing the shape. I was just having fun making... ...strawberries and stuff. We were a bit off-task. So... I can't think of any... So we'll have to... Yeah, I don't know. You could make the touchpad in different shapes, but then it kind of redesigns the whole project. But you could do... Like, sort of a no-way people who get used to having the buttons. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. And it would probably cost more to produce. Yeah, that's just that irregular. How about having different colors and watching them having different shapes, Steve? Yeah. Which is why printing might be... ...like, just printing the fruit on... Well, we've done finance evaluation criteria. Production evaluation. So, project evaluation. You want this, and we'll come up. I guess we're supposed to discuss... ...the process of the project and how satisfied. Oh, it's alright. That's a lot, yeah. Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity? Sort of. Sure. Yeah. I did. I mean, fruit and squishiness, like more creative and spontaneous. The prototype making was very creatively stimulating. And I think we've come up with a product that's fun. And it's all the criteria. And how is our leadership and teamwork? I think it was good. We knew what we were doing. It was a very democratic process. Everyone got to contribute. Well, I thought my leadership was crap personally. Well, you told us when it started and then that's all the others. I think you were fine. You're good, Jeff. I'm never going to do a management position. I know that now. Yeah, I thought we were able to do it together. It all sort of blended. Yeah, I think it more than anything. We didn't really have our set roles so much as we just would be like... I don't know. I thought I could just do it. No spats. That was good. And the means for the materials we used, like convenient, were they? Like the pens, the whiteboard. I mean, one not a big span of any Microsoft PowerPointer. Are you a Mac person? No, no, I never touch Macs either. I just use the Unix or the off-market sort of word perfect and all these other things. Which is a little bit about eating some fat and eating. Well, the problem is if you don't... My new computer never has word perfect. I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and install it. So all these documents, I can't use them. But yeah, I mean, I guess it's okay. I felt like... I don't know if it was just my role, but I thought the information that was available to me was kind of just like... Or maybe it was just the idea that we had, but there was kind of... It was kind of like, okay, I don't really think... I don't know what I'm doing here. So I didn't really think it was helpful. So I kind of just made up my own stuff. And I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations. So I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead. But yeah, I don't really like PowerPoint personally. It's kind of stupid. I never use it. Yeah, but... I can't say I found... Everything particularly helpful. Yeah, I didn't really... Yeah. My first video information was like... It was like a child's drawing. I don't know how it really works. The mind was going to be helpful. My stuff was quite helpful. I mean, my problem... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Because my problem was you guys had access to... Like they send you to sites and stuff, right? Yeah. Yeah, I couldn't do that. So I didn't really know what you guys were doing. And when you were talking about it, it was just like... Yeah, that's why I seemed so ignorant when you were explaining things. Yeah, when mine was mostly made up, except when they told me like, you know, Titanium costs more than they were to make a remote control. Yeah, I wanted to. But it must have been quite difficult for them to build the whole system. A whole system, because it was... I can't give you anything comparable to the internet. Yeah, I mean, I think it's interesting how it all went together. Like I had the stuff about how rubber is cheap and you have how people wanted to be spongy and... Yeah. It seems planned, yeah. Yeah, I kind of thought that... I felt like I would go and like try to use my information or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like... I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because I felt like I was off task all the time. But... I mean, we really got into talking about like personal practice talent. Like it wasn't necessarily what was like... We would never have thought of fruit or sponginess, you know? Yeah, yeah. So I had been told that fruit was... But I think that it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same. Oh right, given certain information or... Yeah, like if everyone's given the same input, I don't know. Anyway, what's next? I know, that's not... Would you guys think of the pens that pass this about? They're pretty cool. I'm going to start to write with them. Yeah. And I forgot once or twice to check the box. I'd like to see what it looks like. They're nicer than the pen that I'm using. Because like your stuff actually shows up here rather than having to look at the screen and write. That's even so, I don't know. And new ideas found? That's all very new. Yeah. I think I'd like to... I don't know. I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down, but they're kind of clumsy. I guess I need... I guess I need to go to the left. Can I drop off if you like moved too much? Yeah, I don't know, but they're... I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones. Maybe we are. I don't know. I think... And I think that... Well, this technology... I guess some people must be interested in using it, but I can't imagine finding it anymore useful than like looking at someone's notes or... Well, I actually worked in a company and I had a role and I had to go to meetings. And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video because I missed a meeting. Like, usually I miss meetings deliberately. There's just... It's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting. Like when you're actually in a real meeting in a real company. It's mostly like rehashing old stuff and just sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's really want tasks you already know. It's like there's just really not a lot of information. It's kind of like an excessive... It seems like way overkill. Like if I missed a meeting, I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence. I wouldn't need to have to watch like a two-hour video with a sound and a transcript. I guess it would be... It's gotta be worth it. I'm just mostly curious about what kind of person or like company would really find it useful. I can't really imagine. How about a pita? I don't know. Well, it's anyone want to talk about fruit more while we slow off time? Any other ideas? What was beyond... Are we supposed to... Are we supposed to watch the port? Are we ending? We still have time if they send any other input. I mean, I think we did really well personally, which is why we've gone through this so quickly. Because I mean, we all kind of agree that our product is satisfactory. It fits the budget. It's trendy. It's amazing. I'm a bit different. So I think that's all for today. Okay, I've got to fill in all this stuff. Meeting a chair and maybe a chair. I think I've learned not to bring in play notes meetings. I think it would be a good idea. I'd probably love to get people actually paying attention, especially if they have food. So I guess we're supposed to write final reports. Yes. I don't know. One is eight, nine, eight. Where's that just me?
