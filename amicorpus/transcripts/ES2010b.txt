 I'm going to go. Was the questioner supposed to be filled in before after the winter? We just got a third one. Do you want us to do it really fast? Or wait. Oh yeah, that was quick. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Okay. I'm going to go. Okay. I'm going to go. Okay. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And we also need to determine the specific functions of this. Just to get it all out on paper. So we said it needs to send messages to the TV. It needs to change the channel. Turn on and off. Just basic simple stuff like this. And we'll add it to my meeting minutes. Most channel. On-off button volume. And channel. Yeah. Those are the most important ones. And we want to keep, I'll make a note here that we want to keep the number of buttons down. Correct. Because people only use 10%. Yeah. Okay. Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily? I think so. What do you? Sure. Yeah. So, what do you think, Coach? How are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it? Because people really are looking for our methods. What if we gave it a charger? And on the charger, just like a phone. Like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger. Leave your phone somewhere. You push the button to find it. It finds the phone really go through. Because it's useful for the remote phone. Yeah. Would that add to our cost at all? I wonder. I would think so because you'd have to develop a base. Well, if you have a base, you can start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery. Yeah. Ret headable batteries are cheaper usually. Okay. I think we can make a decision about that later. We need to discuss that. So, that would include battery source. Power source rather. Is it going to have a charger? Or is it going to be run strictly out of batteries? And we also need to deal with the issue that you mentioned of speech recognition. If we want. If we have a speech recognition, then we can start aiming it at another kind of more handicapped disabled demographic. Well, there's the people who desire speech recognition. There's the different demographics have different desires. I don't know if you guys can. You could, it wouldn't copy onto the things it's black. But all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition. So, basically older people don't really care. It's really the people 25 to 35. I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of TV though. They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas. And if we introduce it when they're at this age, they're going to probably always buy a remote that has. Then do you put voice recognition? Do you put the receiver on the actual television in the bass or in the actual remote? Because then you've already got the remote in the hand. Why are you just going to speak to the remote? Right. Whereas if you just speak and done all and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it. Yeah. Well, and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device too. If we said find remote, locate remote or something. A certain phrase, then it could beep. Just thrown it out there. Yeah. Well. 15 minutes. Okay. Anything else you want to discuss? Well, do we want to include the numbers like 0-3-9? Can we conceive of leaving them out? Wait, on the remote itself? Yeah. Like you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0. Well, we definitely need those. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think if you can conceive it's like, well, I don't know. It's just a way of leaving them out. I think people would find that too foreign. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. You definitely know that. Also, remember that in this day and age, we need like a hundred button too. I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like 50. So I couldn't, whenever I got cable, I had to get a new TV. So we can get satellite. Yeah. Yeah. So you get your own remote or digital cable. Yeah. Okay. I guess we're going to discuss the project financing later, making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget. Yeah, because I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment. So I don't forget we need to include the color of our company and the logo. The color being yellow. I'm guessing. I feel like the yellow are too garish. We could just have the logo in yellow or maybe a yellow light for the keys. Oh, like stripes. Oh, yeah, yellow. Yeah. Yellow could be, and it doesn't have to be huge. Yeah. Well, if you have like a, you have sort of strip kind of down at the bottom. The base of it. It's just like yellow with the RR. Right. So we've simplified. We don't need all those play fast forward rewind. Right. Yeah. No menu buttons. So we've pretty much paired it down to on-off volume, mute, channel up and down. The numbers. Yeah. Can we go back to, I'm going to look really quickly back at those two examples. Yeah. And see if there's anything. Which one is yours? Technical functions. So, yeah. So, yeah. Yeah. Audio settings and screen settings. We need those like audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, screen settings like brightness color. Or do we just want that access access from television itself? I think that that's fine just through the TV. I mean, how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff? Well, the other option is sort of like down at the bottom, like farther away. You just have the sort of box in that where it's like the button so you don't use as much, but occasionally you will use. Yeah, because we need to, we definitely need to have buttons for like subtitles and things like that. Because the foreign film market is expanding and stuff. And like on television, like I know living in Los Angeles. It's tons of Spanish network television. And if it has English subtitles, it's definitely helpful. Can we do that off through one button? Something like a menu button that pops up at the menu on the TV that says, you know, audio, video, whatever, language, you know? Right. So, we need up, down inside the side buttons. Well, that's for the menu. You can just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons. That's true. Yeah. The channel's just up and down. Okay, yeah. Something that, such as, yeah, the one, you know, the one over there on the left, the engineering center. Right, right, right. That one. So we just have like add a menu button then for the various things needed. Including the way to make a mission if you have any like settings for voice recognition though. Including the menu. Yep. We've just got an idea for a design. That's pretty good. Anybody have anything else I'd like to bring up in this meeting? I had something but I forgot. Okay. You can get out of here. Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next. All right. After this meeting, we're going to be sent a questionnaire and summary again, which we need to reply to that email. And then we're going to have lunch break. And after lunch, 30 minutes of individual work time. I'm going to put the minutes, I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the product documents folder. If you'd like to review them and I'm going to type up the minutes for this one as well. Here's what we're each going to do. The ID is going to work on the components concept. UID, the user interface concept, and you're going to do some trend watching. Hey, specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. And if anybody has anything they would like to add? No? Okay. Well, this meeting is officially over. Thank you all.
