 Played out. Played out as edible. Did you know that? It's definitely because kids. I just do. Definitely eating it before I had it not less. Yeah. But it's it's my edible because yeah it's my edible because kids eat it. Yeah. If it wasn't edible then well no more better. I still make sense because I remember like I don't know if my mom ever did it. I remember other people's mom's making I come in and played over. You just like make the baby's coloring and mix. Oh yeah it is. Yeah. But everybody everybody ready? Yep. Okay let's have your um we've got let's get guys have the presentation. Yeah. It's pretty exciting. So everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber. Very simple and easy to use. Double curved. Yeah double curved. But also something that was going to jump out at people or something that would be different separated from the other. Remote's out on the market. So I think if you put this in the palm of your hand you'll see what a nice thing we have going here. That's cool. So basically if you hold it like that the one on your thumb. Yeah the thumb button is the power button. Index finger is channel up. Middle finger is channel down ring finger is volume up. Pinky is volume down. What's the big blue thing? That's the lock button. And then the M is a mute button. And then also has plus I said what button M for muting. And also there's an numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the channel if you want. So it's really basic functionality as far as what keys are available but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative. It looks different. That's it. It does. So all the important keys are right at your right at a convenient place for you to access them. So you don't need to. And to your side. Yeah it should be. And it's also conformable to the size of your hand. I mean if that's too big it's a rubber remote. Yeah. You can. Great. Is that what? Mesh with what you guys were hoping when for expecting on. I have one thing about it. But it's a small thing but maybe we'd have to make a white handed one and a left handed one. I like it. That's good thinking. But I don't see why that's not possible. If we build rocket ships I can't build a left handed one. Yeah. They might left handed scissors. Yeah. I didn't think about that. But then you can learn to use your right hand. Like I was thinking it's this left hand, there's hand right hand, there's in the family. What do they have to remote? I know people who have left handed and right handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole, the same computer for the first family and they have a house. Sure. Sure. Everybody using right handed. Yeah. I'm sure they'll be able to. I mean it's only pressing buttons. You don't have to do anything you know, extraordinary. I think I'm really going to press a button with the left hand, the right hand. Imagine are you right handed? Yeah. Imagine doing it with your left hand. I don't think it's too good. Yeah. It's not. But we can have both. Yeah. Have them in stock. Yeah. Yeah. Make them more appealing. But I'm other than that. I only know, and that's some, you know, that's just something I think. I think it's great. Yeah. Great idea. Do you think it says are I think it's I think it's well if the are motto is we bring fashion to the electronics. I'd say that could be quite fashionable. Yeah. It's got the black and yellow and blue plus red which is sort of a fruit vegetable. So that's that's our inner things. Yeah. Yeah. It's come up with what you know, the thing that's what we what we were looking at doing wasn't it? And it seems to be there. Well done. And all playing around. Before we move on. Yeah. I'm just do you want to plug in? I need that cable. Yeah. Um, one thing I do need to do we need to look at is the costs. The cost is amazing. The plan was very cheap. Well, yeah. I don't want to ask very long. Everybody will go like, oh, it's gone. But it's edible. Well, buy more than the heat. That was, I mean, criteria from the last meeting and have to be cheap proof. Yeah. Right. Okay. Now, I think we'll do this. Yeah. I could do, you know, I can do this. Oh, my God. I could do it with you, but it's just easy enough to go through it with you. So, we're going for the kinesic power. And the electronics we decided on it being just a simple, the easiest thing that's inside it. The case we've gone for the double curved. Um, and it's made out of rubber. The interface is push buttons. And button supplements were all there. They're special colors, aren't they? Yeah. Special colors. Special form. Yeah, they're special form. They're in shapes and stuff. Yeah, I mean, these these ones on the side are curved to kind of stuff. Yeah. Um, they made out of any special material. No, they're not, they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber anything. They're just simple. Well, they're rubber. Okay. So let's see if that comes within budget. And it does. That's going to cost. Yeah, that's going to cost 10, 10 euro, 70 cents a unit to make. And I'll tell you it was it has come in at under 12, 50. Yeah. So, actually making a better profit when you expect it. This is all very, very good. The bosses will be very pleased. Okay, let's just say this so I can email it to you. So, it's very tiny. No, at least say it in the other, my dog kids. Splendid. Okay. So, that's messed me down with this, with this do that. I'm going to do what you were going to do. No, evaluation. Oh, yeah. This is where we all get to, I get to write them the boops and the board. Oh, right. Oh, it's function. Okay. I love this, my play don't. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't spell it. Okay. So, evaluation. We're going to do it all together. So we evaluate it each criteria. I've got the criteria. And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true. So, it's, it's more like it fits the criteria and seven being, as in it doesn't fit the criteria. And the criteria are, and I'll draw this up on the board. So, we have a box. Just so we know true. And this is false. This is just like keep you informed. So, seven is here, and one is here, and then you've got in the middle. So, the first criteria, do you all get what we're doing? Okay, cool. Okay. First criteria, look and feel. So, it does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about. Is it color wise and is it spongy? So, what mark should we give it? I would give it a seven. Yeah. As in, it's not. Oh, sorry, one. So, I'll just write criteria. I'll give it a one. Second criteria, new technology. How we implemented new technology was in the new high tech. Yeah. That was our main technological innovation. Everything else is fairly simple, but the fact that we use the kinetic energy is new. It's ergonomic. Yeah, but that's not a technical thing. That's another thing. That's another marketing thing. So, on the technical side of it, it's about a twist in the middle somewhere maybe. So, criteria three is easy to use. I think it's the one. I'd say it's, I've not, if you're left-handed, it's not. I would give it a two. Two, six. Because it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people. But if we make a right-handed and left-handed, then... If we're going to have one left-handed and one right-handed, then I would give it a one. Give it a two. Yeah, okay. Okay, criteria four is costs. I mean, under budget. So, definitely one. That was good. Mount the buttons. Like the amount of buttons, because people like... I'd say only the necessary buttons. So, it's a one. Yeah. Quaterior six. RSI is a good against. Yes. Very good. It's N-T-R-S-I. It's one. And criteria seven, which is the last one, does it get lost? Is it easy to get lost? I don't think it's going to get lost. No, but it is small. It's not the kind of thing that's going to slip between a couch cushion or something. Maybe it won't. I think they would... We would have two. Yeah. I mean, it's not fully, it's not fully like... No, I mean, it's not a one. I mean, you can still flush it down a toilet, theoretically. Anything. I mean, it's bigger than the average mobile, I guess. Yeah. The mobile's getting lost all the time. But then you ring them and find them. So... Okay. Yeah. So, that's that. That's the evaluation. So, I'd say... Yay. Oh, it's like... Old-systemed girls. Like a number one... Um... Number one product. Hey, we can't file. We've fitted all the criteria. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well done, Risa. That's that one. Okay. I... I think I just want to put in as project manager, the, you know, a little bit of praise for everybody here, for how they've worked on it. You know, both individually and as a team. You know, everyone's come up with their own individual ideas and their own different departments. And then come together and works in, you know, integrally, you know, at the right times, especially you too. That's all, you know, gone very, very well and... You know, it's been good communication going on. Yeah, during our design, and there was some... some heated discussion, but we kept... We tried to keep it cool and... Did you have to go down to the corporate squash court and bash a few bills about? We just had to squeeze our product a little bit. Fantastic. Now, you guys have been a great team. I think we're the, we're the envy of all the, of all the other teams. I think so, I think, you know, I think we've come, we've come up with something new, something that hasn't been done before. We're not just rehashing in our design. In four, in four meetings. Yeah. From your design, and meetings could be this quick. You know, maybe this isn't a simulation. Maybe this is actually... It's like, I think they're so neat or someone like that. They're just, yeah. They get things... Thank you, you're welcome, dude. Yeah. Yeah, we're two years time, this will be on the market. Exactly that product. We'll go, yeah, we design that, and no one will believe us. So, at this stage, I mean, is this the last meeting of the project? We don't have another one after it's gone. No, I think when this meeting's finished, like officially, they'll get a question there. Oh, really? To fill in? Or six? Just not summarizing now. I couldn't apply to the same list. I've got the message. See some way. I just reported that. So, there's no way to predict what... Because we originally had it as far as our financial goals. We had a specific number for profits that we wanted. It was 15... Was it... Was it 50 or five? I don't remember. But there's not a way to compete that. I mean, since we saved on that production cast, do we know how much we're making on profit? It gets handed over to another department. Well, our project was to come up with the product, basically. And just basically, is it within budget? When it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and the profits and all that, that's other departments. It's another team that actually work out the mate that we have invested in, just... Oh, yeah. The old one goes in the profit sharing. Yeah, that's it. You know, we've... We've finished now. We've made... We've designed the product. We've got the prototype. It's within budget. It does everything that we wanted it to do. It's new. It's something that is now there already. I think actually in one advantage of this is that after the... You know, after this bad of fruit and vegetables passes, this will still be a cool... ...fremel. You know, we're not... We're not... You know, tying... tying our cart to that one course. Yeah. But this is very remarkable. And that it is. It's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people to want that. It's... It's... I'm going to write down this somewhere. Oh, I put it in one of my emails that I've sent off. That, you know, it's remarkable in the sense that it's... Whilst all these other emotes actually do give you a pest of strain injury. Our one does the complete opposite. You know, so that's something that's new, which is one of the criteria they ask us to come up with something new. It makes watching TV happy. Yeah, and if you're not having a good time with the TV, you can throw it about, you know. It's fine. It's kid proof. Just don't throw it other than the ornaments and break them. Well, you can break the ornaments, but you won't break that. No. That's right. Yeah. So, all in all, I think we've done very well. Well done, everybody. Yeah. You too. Drinks are on the company. In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we've all just gained access to. That's okay, you know. Yeah. That's it. That's it. Well, as far as I'm... That's it. That's it. Well, as far as I know. We haven't got the five minutes left thing yet. No. You ever want to play ice-bite? I guess it's probably better than we wrap it up in here. Five minutes left. That sounds... Should we call it a dinner? Yeah, I guess. I mean, we're going to get asked to fill out another question there. It's probably going to be the same as one we've done before. I'm not the authority to say that it is. How does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this? That's sort of using the pens and writing on these special pads and all that. I love it. I love it. I think it's cool. You know, wired up and vibrating pen and cool. Being watched. Your moment, Tashui. Well. I think, you know, I'd... Yeah, as we said earlier, I've not never seen that before. Yeah. Something that... The whiteboard. Yeah. The thingy. That's great. But a pen with a camera on it, I don't think it's such a new thing. I mean, it's an orn such a new idea. It would be different if it was sort of handwriting recognition stuff, but as it's not, it's literally that or come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text. Right. I think they do want to do hand-writing. Yeah. It's just the first step. Mm-hmm. The lucky tech. I guess we should end this as well. Ah, public. Yeah. Meeting the dirt. Yeah.
