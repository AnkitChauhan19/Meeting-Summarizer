 I think I should probably try to sit up straight. Like that? Okay, cool. Okay? Okay? I think my phone is still there as well. Like this? It's going to be hard to drink. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right. So I'm just going to start this PowerPoint real quick. Yeah. Powerpoint. Very official. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. I kind of like this. Kind of getting into it. Right. So just to kick off the meeting basically. So we're working now for a real reality. This is, oh, so, right. It's just got an agenda to set out what we're going to try to accomplish in this particular first meeting. We're going to just do a quick opening. And we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another. Then we're going to start to talk a little bit about tool training. Essentially, that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet. The whiteboard. We've got a general plan for the project. How we're going to go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion and close up. IRL, you guys, you know, gamers lying in real life. So yeah, basically, I want to, I'm just going to, you got, of course, we can discuss that. I'm thinking about proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask, don't tell. So if you say something about marketing, right, sort of. I'm just going to believe that you can have a couple of them there. Exactly. I mean, if you guys, at the same time, if you, like logically, if something doesn't, like I'm like, we're going to sell remote control that's the size of this paper book, you know. You're just like, well, that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X. Obviously, go with it. I'm going to discuss it, but I'm not going to ask. Do you know that? Or it seems like. Correct. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So because we're sort of role-playing, you're going to tap into your own knowledge as well. And that's the same for you when we do introductions. I mean, and you talk about your background, you know, have fun. You know, maybe you went to, you know, maybe you're like me and you went to UCSB, but you want to say you went to Harvard or something like that. Why not? You know, you can, this is, you know, I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it. So are you guys okay with that? Does that seem logical? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it's fun. It's your book for me. It's sweet. Cool. So I guess we're totally, we're making a remote control, which is thrilling. But the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate motto. I don't know if you guys had time to check the, in real life, I don't know if you guys would have checked the, the corporate website. We've got to make something as fashionable as possible. That's kind of the corporate strategies. We're going to try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice. You know, like John Lewis Knyser, you know, if you go to DevonM's or something. So basically we are reinventing the wheel, but we want to try to do it in a user friendly slick, sleek kind of way. What we're going to go about doing that is basically at first we're going to start on the basics. And that's where I'm going to need you guys to use your interface designers and the other designer that I can't remember the, the ID and the UID. Right. The industrial designer, hey, you can do it to guide me and guide us on this project because you're going to be, you're going to be, you guys with the bottom, you know, you're like, no, you can't do that. You can't have, you know, X and Y at the same time. And then we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good, you know, like, I think you guys probably got the same email as I did, but the idea of, yes, a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee. But it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that if you touch it, you hurt your hand or something like that. And so we'll work up from there and then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage. You know what you guys build or tell me to tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can hope for and what way to go, take the basics and make it nicer. And then obviously the UID and the ID, you know, you can keep on, you know, cutting edge of how to get about maximizing what is possible to try to sink it all up. So that's a detailed design. So it's a three stage kind of thing. Right. So for now, just for the whiteboard, basically just to get used to it, I haven't tried it yet either. I'm just going to start and carry like five remote around. And just write down, I'm just going to write down one of the names of my desert disks. If you were trapped on a desert island and you can only bring five CDs along with you, name one of them that you could not all five. If you want to write all five, go for it, but name one of them that you could. Oh, we skipped introductions. Nice. I'm an excellent project manager. I'm Marty. I went to uni at UC Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a PhD in psychology. Yeah. So. I'm Sarah. I went to Michigan and I'm here to cultural studies and I'm marketing manager or something marketing expert. Don't play yourself down. I'm expert. I'm Ron. I once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the user interface designer. I'm Nathan. I'm from California and I'm here doing a master screen social college. Where'd you go to get in here? You see. I've been in my little brother goes there. Okay. Right. So desert island disks. So we have to wait for you to write it down. Are you going to tell us? Well, no, no, I'm just going to write a couple of them down. See, I'm a big music fan. I don't know if you guys are. I'm assuming everybody likes music. It's some lesser, greater extent, but there's some other options. If you're a TV slut like I am like small bill terrible television show, but I happen to love it. It's rubbish, but I love it. I went to high school with Tom willing, actually. The main thing. The guy. Wow. Yeah. Is he a wanker? Yeah. Very much so. He's a really tall. He's got to be like six six. He's a big guy. Okay, so I really like Jeff Buckley. You guys are Jeff Buckley. That's cool because like not very many people have. And oh well, I'm at his will throw a British person in there. You can't go wrong with radio. Okay, so it really works just like a panel and it makes noises I think. It's kind of weird. Anyway, yeah, yeah, you like pressing those. You'll see. Alright, so whoever wants to get up next, you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want. I guess I'll go next. Right on. Okay, we lose all my mics plugged in here. Okay. This is basically just pen practice, huh? Okay. Oh, you're much taller than me. So I'm going to write down here. Right now, I'm listening to a lot of somebody knows ever heard of Chris Bathgate, local Michigan folk singer. Nice. Really lame. And what else can I bring with me? Probably classical to Tony Leakey. Yeah, I think. And my family guy DVDs. Well, yeah, we don't need to write that one down. Oh, family guy. Do you watch the new season? No. Are you getting it online or is it? I think I'm going to start downloading it. Yeah, that'd be nice. Alright. I'm just going to put down one CD. Okay. Anybody? How do you know? Afrobeat orchestra. Very cool. Afrobeat orchestra. Yeah, very cool. It's like 15 members from Brooklyn. And I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium. That's awesome. Thanks, I think. Yeah, it's supposed to be. I'm excited. I think I love about Enra. I didn't read those. I should admit that. That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for. They're designed specifically to ignore. It's the five by five. I can't read that much. Ah, yes. That's okay. Vomit. Yes. Street pizza. That's so brilliant. Yeah. It's so horrible. I've seen more urine in this city than ever before. Seriously. But I just came from Glasgow and I'm happy to say that there's more. There's a same quantity of approximately. It's so mean. It really is. Oh. Does, uh, yeah. Ready? All right. Yeah. Mingen. Nice. Yeah. I'm going there. You're in the middle. You're in the middle. Yeah. You're going local. I have to be here for three years. I'm going to look at the terminology. I've already got more than I can keep track of. I'm going to be like, oh my god. You're turning into one of those people. Have you been home yet? No. They'll be like, say something British and you're like, oh, shut up. Hey, you're home. Oh, it should be interesting. We can tell I tell them I'm not going back. You're going to love that one. You're going to stay here. Probably. Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide. Is that religion? Yeah. Some music I grew up listening to. Yeah, yeah. And. Now I can think of somebody other one. Well, yeah, that's why. That's how it works. Yeah. Something I miss about my hometown. I miss coffee. Burritos. Burritos. Oh. And cost less than two bucks. Oh, yeah. Two bucks. And things that are like. Where are you from in California, by the way? I grew up in San Diego. But yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm from San Diego as well. Yeah. But really. I last lived in San Francisco. I haven't lived in California. Well, I haven't lived in something California since I was 18. I've lived in San Diego. I've lived in San Diego. I've lived in San Diego. I've lived in San Diego. For when? It's not like. I'm sorry. You just can't get a bit of freedom than what's available in San Diego. It's different. Because in San Diego, the tortillas are cooked on the grill. They're the California steaming them. It must make all the difference. Yeah, really does. Well, it's, it's, there's other things too. There's, you just can't place it. Like, when I went to school in Santa Barbara, which is central California, the Mexican food is okay. It's just not good. Like, yeah. It's like two bucks. like literally two bucks for this mask. I miss. Yeah. Good call on that. Where are you from in San Diego? Just literally just metropolitan San Diego. I live like five minutes from the zoo. Okay. So North Park, actually, if you want to get real space. Yeah, my grandparents lived on a 30 second. Yep. Close to you know, we're at Clare de Linde coffee shops. Yes. On University. Yeah. Yeah, it's actually like literally half a mile from my house. Cool. Yeah, pretty cool. Small world. That's a great thing before, especially when we're off from the same general region. Right. So okay, success on the whiteboard. Yeah. You can harness the awesome power. A little bit of introductions. We talked about some of our CDs and things we like about the city. I think we'll. Right. So moving on to not fun stuff. Project finance. Basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for 25 euros. This is what the finance department has told me, the CFO, but I don't know. I'm not sold on this. It's pretty dear. I mean, 20th, that's like, you know, 40 bucks for a remote. It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me. So we can maybe work on that later, but we're going to make a lot on it. The profit aims to make 50 million euros on it. You're internationally. So one of the things I was going to mention to you, you guys, the designers is that we probably need to remember. It needs to be a universal remote control probably. Okay. So something that could do NTSC as well as PAL as well as various other formats. I think it's going to control DVDs, but you know, I'll leave that to you guys, but that's something that is going to be an international sold thing. But we want to try to make it for 1250. So we want to try to make 100% profit on it if we can. Right. So just to close up, I'm not sure how much time I've used it next time. Project manager sort of is. Because I will meet another half an hour or so. And I'd like the industrial designer to get, think about what needs to be done, like what the basic function of it. UID, well, yeah, your assignments are up there and you'll also get assignments from in your email as well, more specific on what to do. Basically, I need you to tell us what we, what the user is going to want. So actually in a way, you guys, maybe in our next meeting, chat a bit about what the user is going to want and what the user can have. You know, like, you go and shape that. Yeah, well, it is. And we'll discuss the trade offs in between. And so, yeah, specific instructions will be sent in your email. But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now. And there's more things come up. We'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth. Any questions before we get started? I assume that we're building a standalone remote control. We can't kind of build it into other products. You mean to like, for instance, like a mobile phone? It's interesting. Yeah. I don't think there's any rules about it yet. Maybe our personal coach. Yeah. Or, you know, can we produce, can we sell a remote control phone for 25 pounds or less? Well, I have a think about it. I mean, I'm certainly open. It seems like, yeah, it seems like it's certainly doable, isn't it? I mean, or if we can't have a full mobile phone, maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function, the clap. No, I mean, no, good idea. Good idea. Let's see. Every remote with changeable faces like face-leafed by fast. I like that. I like that. I like that. Hot. Yeah. That's true. I guess we probably have some time. Maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we want to do. Go back to where they have it. Let me bring up something about our basic goals here, what we want to accomplish. Project announcements. Yeah. Not so much. All right, we'll find that we're on our own. Now, are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all? Yeah, yeah, let's do it. Let's do it. Same way, have any initial ideas. I'm going to go ahead and take notes on this too, because... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, it's pretty much given. It's going to be universal, where you'll get it excited about it, already, and it may be functioning for other things. As soon as you said that, it was going to be like all the other things you get emotes to, like your microwave or your front door, like to have everything on one thing. But then never going to fanned those huge remotes that have like a million buttons you can't tell what they do. or is better? Yeah. I'm thinking specific. I'm thinking kind of pda design, so touch screen design rather than button. I hope so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things. Yeah that slick isn't it. I mean like stylus. Yeah. Yeah. So we got five minutes more to chat about. That's perfect. So we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between size and functionality. We also multi-functional but at the same time if you do too much you're not going to be able to tell them apart. It's going to be too complicated. It's a crowded button. I'm also going to note for future reference this idea. So you like to remember I can help like a touch screen type of remote. I don't think one of these needs one outstanding feature instead of apart from all the other units. Yeah all the other universal amounts. I don't know if there's such thing out there. I guess we'll do some research on it or one of us can do some research on it about whether or not there are multi-format like you know PAL and PSC region one. I'm pretty sure there is. I mean I have a friend who has a pda that he just points at any television he wants and it'll figure out the specifications of it and we'll control it. Interesting. I assume that that can be done with around the world. Okay. All right so I'm liking that idea. This idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features. Let's see. I think making it out of a nice material would be very important because so many of those remote states that you see these universal remote looks so cheap and low quality. Yeah it's even nice and slick would be important and I don't know like there's such a problem with losing them. That adding this whole like pda pen business is only one more thing to lose so we're going to be careful of what like just something like keep in mind and we start actually deal with this stuff but that would be really cool. Let's see. I like the idea of the multi-plate. Yeah yeah. What do they call those faceplate paint? They're name-able face plates. Are they? I don't know. I like it. We'll have to come up in. Yeah. We should come up with a fuzzy one as well. I think it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a located device. Maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote. But if we're bundling it in less for selling their tele with the remote. Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it. You're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either. Well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying. Could we not do something where like just a little literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you can place somewhere else that you press and it makes the remote page. Kind of like how on a lot of cordless regular phones you have a page button. Could we do something like that? That's cool. I think so. I think we could design that. Yeah. Good. Yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of Apple has been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or the sleek kind of. And titanium and the new silver sleek ones with lots of the years. Yeah. Very much so. Curves. We do have the minimum amount. I mean we were talking finances that are not selling a 40 pound remote. Our $40 remote, 25 year remote would be pretty expensive. So maybe we might want to trade off some of the features for a lower price without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargains for universal remote that's black and you know massive some kind of I don't know a balance there in somewhere. Definitely. But um have a think about what we can do have a think about what we want to do how we're going to sell it. And our users in mind like these grandlays are not going to be into this whole new let's design it. No it's the use of the buttons. I lost to be careful of exactly what marketing is to and who we're going to be able to get it out of. It's true. I'm talking 25 pound through 25 years. 25 years. It's late. I guess. Yeah. They're all weaker than they're all stronger than the dollar. Although computer parts. Oh if you're going to upgrade your computer by it in the States. Like um do you guys know fries? Huge computer uh electronic store. These serve um are they say they will sell things overseas. So you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like 23 pounds like that. Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now. I'm going to put these initial ideas that we've got in the project documents. So if you guys need a reminder about what we've talked about on the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got in the other ideas you can consult them at your leisure. And uh right so thanks for that. Let's just head back to work on what we were talking about uh go ahead get going too. You have an hour? Yes. Okay perfect. Thanks guys. Cool. Thank you. Right.
