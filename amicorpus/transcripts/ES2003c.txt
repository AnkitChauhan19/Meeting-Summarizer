 All right, yep. Okay. So we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes. I think to sum up the last meeting with Beat is say the requirements that we've set out. Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on a small joystick LCD and a couple of other buttons for navigation with power being was supposed one of the main single purpose buttons. We were also going to use a novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter or any luck the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design. Looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control of any luck. Pretty much sums up the last one. So we'll just crack on. Like to maybe start with the industrial designer if it's possible. Okay. Today is the conceptual today. This meeting is a conceptual design phase and is. What parts might be made of? Can we outsource these from elsewhere? Well, we have to construct the items ourselves. I have a presentation area. I just said that in the. Yeah, okay. I'll just I'll load it up then. Oh, interface concept. That's you. We've got train watching. Components design. Okay. So. The case. That's what our first of all could be plastic. But later on. We can we can be rubber as well or titanium or even wood. So. We need the infrared transmitter. Get that off the shaft. Joystick will probably never going to use it. And could be. Plastic rubber even as well. And if you go on to the next slide. But if you go on to findings, it's two or three slides. So this is what our family can use. Three different types of batteries. Can either use a hand dynamo or the kinetic type ones. You know that they're using watches. So the power. Now the kinetic one. Because. Because that's the ones where like you the movement causes it. The battery for a watch wouldn't require a lot of power would be my one query. Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power? Do you think watch moves around a great deal more? I think it would. And so does I don't know that. The inside and all. Probably just use conventional batteries. And. Which is supposed as well would allow us to go off the shelf again each. These are three different types of three different types of shapes. You can have what is flat one. And then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved. The materials are there as you can see. But can't have a tiny one for a double curved. The titanium they're really strong metal. Is it also a quick sense? I don't know if you'd be able to have the top of your head or not. The single curved double curved. Would you be able to give an example? Could you maybe draw something that you don't have to be perfect. It's just because I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two. The first was thinking for sitting at the palm of your hand. Maybe like this with the joy pod here. Just secure. And maybe. And okay button around here so that the film can use it quite easily. I don't exactly double curves. The public means this is probably double curved. Whereas a single curved would be. I guess. So it might literally just be two curves. Okay. Whereas this is two curves. So I guess that's what they mean by a double curve. Which looks better than a single curved. You can't have it in titanium. Nice material. For the buttons. You can have the scroll wheel which they use in the mouse's. These are the pieces. And it requires more expensive chip to use. If you want to use LCD, it's more expensive. So you can just slide. If you want the buttons to be. Oh yeah, if you have a double curved. Control on its rover. Then you have to use rover buttons as well. Push. You're going to have to have a number keypad. Anyways, for the amount of channels these days. You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels together when you want to. You want to enter just the number if you know. So. I'm going to have to have a number keypad. Okay. Definitely something we can talk about. So you've got a little bit about the chip that we might require as well. So. Depends where. I'm going to spend the money. If you want to fancy LCD. Do you have any idea so far? When we're saying that we need an advanced chip for an LCD. Does that shoot the cost up by a drastic amount? Or. Or. I think compared to the pressing of buttons. If you press the button. It sends a certain transmission. Through the infrared, whereas something if we're controlling the LCD we definitely require a much more powerful chip. Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think. If I've not overstepped. Okay. Should I go on over. If we only have 12 pounds 50 to have euros not even 12 pounds 12 euros was that like eight pounds is not like that. Well, we'd also be relying on the the bulk buying and. I assume we have to look into the cost. So sorry. The previous slides just explain what's the internal components of the. You know, control if you don't want before that. So it just says what does. Try to take the key press into the infrared signal and this is received by TV. The chip just needs to take the key press. And then it's added to the trap the amplifier. Okay. And then the next slide shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons. Developing the buttons to get sent to the chip. So that's just how the. And it's a side on what. What is it? Okay. Here's a second. So in the information that you've been supplied how feasible would you say that the idea of using an LCD looks. I think we can do it. We use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or a kinetic. And then maybe use single curved case because you might need to be curved for the. Call to use the choice choice. And then you may be a fast chip. I mean, that sounds like quite a good requirement to me. Conventional battery would seem to make sense. I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved. And I don't know about anybody else, but. Plastic rubber as a traditional format casing would seem to be a good way forward. I'm actually going to be a golden go straight for rubber. For reason. I'll go into that. I also have a preference for. Okay. Well, um, based on my reasons. Yeah. Well, we want to use her interface and. Yeah. Sorry, as long as we use. Yeah. Okay. And. And. And. Interface concept. I'm going to have to work between the. The slides and the. Yeah. And the whiteboard because I actually have some fairly concrete things. It's time. Now, I was given an. An HTML file giving various ideas from. From other previous remote control designs and. Pretty much decided to just dump them off. I wasn't very impressed by them. And they didn't seem to read nothing I saw seem to meet the sorts of design specifications that were going for today. So what. Rather than looking at other remote. It will be better to simply look at the human hand. And try and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on. So every. So the finger is each finger or some is wherever it needs to be already. So. Next slide. Please. And what would basically decided almost the. The joystick to function buttons and the LCD is keeping it paired down to the absolute minimum. I don't actually think we need the. The numeric keypad because if you because one of the menus that we could have available. The via the LCD is one of the scroll through channels. So there's something. And bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for. It's quite a good. For digital or. Or for cable or whatever. You're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels. And then. Your V. And then the channel for your VCR and our DVD player. And our. Set top box. So it's not. I'm not really excessive. And then. Because I have two modes basic mode. Where the joystick left right left right for channels up down for volume. And the. And menu mode. For further functions. And the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is if we're going to have a high ergonomic design. It needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people. Can I jump in slightly there? That would suggest the double curve design is probably going to be most appropriate then. Yes, absolutely. Okay. Basically what I. Basically what the what the room would be having. I would say the whole thing articulated at two points. So if you're. If you're handing it from a letter left or right handed you can adjust it so that the. The LCD and the. The joystick would be in the right place. Also, this is a rather nicer design gimmick that the. The whole thing should have sort of organic feel to it. It should be. Soft to touch and can be moved around. On to the next. To the next slide. Just letting over will probably quite tight for time as well. Okay. Because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say I guess. Yeah. Okay. Basically. I can. Add pretty pictures to this. The. Assuming the hand the hand to be in a sort of this position. Um, not hold holding the remote. The, um, the joystick unit should rest over the. The joint of the four finger. So it's directly visible for the thumb. And it would need to be a. It would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around. For left or right handed users. So. You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same. The respective of hand in this. You just have big, two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can. And the upper part one for the four finger one for the middle finger. Is this the joystick? The, this part here is the joystick. This would be the actual grip probably where you don't have the battery is well. Okay. That would be probably the bulkiest part. And you then have at the, uh, at the bottom. The LCD and this would need to be articulated as well. And basically I want this to rest here right at the base of the wrist. So it would fit just nicely in the hand. And again, this part could be. Rotated so it can. So, so that it can be adjusted either left or right handed user. So the top, the top function button in basic mode would be the on-off switch. And menu mode would be the enter button. And then the bottom function button switches between, between modes. Now programming it. Actually, this is one thing I found with. The replacement remote control programming them can be a right pain. So I thought the simplest way around that would be to have a cable to connect it to computer some. Some fair, we're going to have some fairly, fairly simple software on the computer just so that you, on your phone computer, just so that you could pro program it at a rather, any rather more comfortable interface. And you could download programs for it from TVs from all of the main manufacturers. Though it would be necessary to have a, have a, have a mood for programming it without the computer. Just in case there are, there are still people left out there who don't have them yet. Yeah. Okay, that's my idea. Actually, right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So to gather my research, three basic methods, we compared whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff, but they want it to look cool. And then we, we research our fashion trends in Europe, what's, what's the new black, you know, as it grows. Next slide, please. We found the north of importance. People want the remote control to look cool more than they wanted to, to be cool. They wanted to do a lot of goods. They wanted to look like it does a lot. And if it does do a lot, that's a bonus, but they don't care so much, you know. They want it to be, that sounds a bit like a contradiction, technology, technical, technologically innovative. If you wanted to be that, but still they care more about the way it looks than what it does. So like the interface is really important. And easy to use. It just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important. I mean, the second point is twice as important as the third point. People want it. It has to be cooler than easy to use, you know, if it has the newer speeches, even if it's difficult to use to prefer it to have the newer speeches. And if it's easy to use, that's a bonus. Now this seems a bit odd to me, but fruit and bears is the new, the new black for furniture, for clothes, for shoes. Had that relates to remote control, I don't know. But I see, I'll come onto that in the next slide. Spungy, I've always been saying everything is the new black, or spongy is the new black as well. So we had the choice between rubber and plastic. If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze, you know, it's spongy, then that's good for lunch. Not the rubber material is the type of stressful material. Okay, just normal rubber. Okay, so kind of spongy material. So, okay. So my personal opinion. We want some advanced internet technologically innovative, obviously. But what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool. That's different, you know, that's everyone has a white remote control, black remote control. You need something cool. Like titanium is cool, but it's expensive. And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control. Now the fruit and veg options. Even we go in that direction, or we stay totally away from it. I mean, the research did come up with fruit and veg, so maybe it is important. It's up to them to face guy. So if we stay away from it, you know, stay away from it. But if we're going to go along with it, then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that or a kiwi fruit. There could be something like, I say potato field, but I'm sure you guys have a much cooler idea than I do. So I think cool is the key. I have a few questions about a swanji remote control. I've never seen one before. I've seen plastic remote controls. I think maybe they were, I don't know, back in the day when they first came up with remote controls, they had a reason for it being sturdy, you know, for being stronger sturdy. So if we want something stronger than sturdy, I say, stay replaceable titanium. But if we go with spongy, we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want. It doesn't matter, spongy material is not going to break, you know. I just don't know how the LED and the lights are going to fit into a spongy material because it's not going to be completely squeezable. So how do things fit in? And if we are going to use spongy, we can say it's long lasting, you know, it's damaged resistant stuff like that. So just to summarize, people want stuff that's cool, that's, that looks like it's cool. And if it is called nest of bonus, where there's nothing to be, people like fruiting veg, we can even go down that alley or stay totally away from it. People like spongy material, if we're going to use spongy material, we have to think of how practical it is and how we can further promote that idea. And also this was this year. So things change all the time every year, you know, they always talk about this year, this is a new black. Well, next year, something else is going to be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruiting veg. That's me. Well, I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway. You always have to bring out new designs. So if we can get next year than that's possibly a good place to start anyway. It seems like a lot of components could be off the shelf. So I don't know exactly what cost would be incurred. I can see your point about the numbered key back, but I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system. If you need to do traversal of a large number of channels, my feeling would be that even if later date this was to be taking control of set-top boxes as well. And these of the LCD and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be. Actually, if you've got a lot of channels, the numbered key back can be quite annoying as well because if you're trying to remember what numbers the discovery child is. That's a good point. You can go for it names. But if you have a menu structure, then you can subgroup them. Okay. You can use music. Like they do on it. It's kind of digital. Yeah. Yeah. So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components. Say something like, um, lithium ion battery, the kind that you find in most, um, small handheld devices now. Looks like we're going for a double curve design. Um, I don't know what cost implications there are in that. Um, looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber. What I'd have to say, depending on how flexible it is, we might need to have some kind of inner frame. Yeah. I would say definitely. I mean, the study of having it was articulated. There would be basically two points of articulation. One below and one above the, uh, the mains are grip. Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation? I can see why it looks appealing, but it could be a weak point in, um, the structure, do you think? That would be a woodie of mine. You're going to put in the edge saying, uh, it's like a banana. Oh, I don't think there would be a structural weakness. I mean, if you have a firm substructure, you can then incorporate your articulation into that. If you then have, as a outer skin of, um, flexible spongy rubber, then you have something that is very much, you know, organic. I think it would look rather cool. I mean, drawing there doesn't do it just as it makes it. It makes you look a little bit more like a vibrator than a, uh, then a remote control. But, uh, we went out that functionality. I wear one interesting point is I don't know how serious you were there. But if we take some of the ideas over banana, why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the, the color of the logo? Sure. Yeah. It's certainly a different color from your average, um, make it harder to lose as well. Yeah. Was there anything in your research? The noise for when you lose the banana. Yeah, for when you lose the remote control, it could be like a monkey noise or something like that rather than a standard B. You know, you lose the monkey that banana. You press a button and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana. I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable. They'll be have monkeys default. Oh, I was going to talk about the programmable remote control. Now, I think it would be cool if you had one remote control that can work with old TVs. You know, you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. But why you need to program it like a standard feature, I don't know. Well, basically, the, um, for, I mean, each manufacturer will have a particular, we'll have a particular command set that the TV responds. Yeah. It's not simply a matter of frequency. So, um, usually what's done is you have a big booklet full of different possible. You'll have all of them sort of programmed into the remote and you'll have this little booklet of codes. You then find your, um, find your manufacturer and try the different codes that come under that manufacturer's name until you find the right one. That's because televisions, they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it. Yeah, that's right. So, that's, that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that. But if we had, um, some sort of hook up into your computer as an option, then if you've got a computer, you can avoid that rather irritating. An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer, we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes, maybe we can have it for one of the options they have is it they look up the name of a company on the LCD and then maybe look up different names of, um, different actual units have been produced. Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like, does a Stu for correct function and such. Is it, is it actually a book of names to digits or is it like a few pages? Um, booklet, some pages. I just think if we were to store this information, some type of mapping, this person probably need to use this feature like once, you know, when he first buy the remote control whenever they buy a new television. So, once every, you have to be used very often. Yeah, and it's, but it's a, but it's a nuisance. And it's a nuisance very close to the, to, um, to actually purchasing it. So it's something you're likely to be thinking about. If there's one in the shop that says it can avoid much of that nuisance, you might be favorably inclined towards it. Um, okay, this is just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage. I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway. This was a conceptual one. Um, I think we've come up, I think we've covered everything we need to here. Um, I think we've decided on what, you know, decided on standard items for most of them, rubber and such. So, and we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting. So, for example, um, we'll just start at the top. You've got yourself and the industrial and designer going to be working quite closely at this stage, because it'll be hard not to, obviously. Looking for a phototyping of some of this description using clay. Um, I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as a progress. Um, the user interface design. It looks like the idea of push forward so far is maybe more of a physical one now, where it's possibly be more interested in maybe how the LCD is going to incorporate, do you think? Or do you foresee that most of the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout? Um, well, I think other than getting us more aesthetically pleasing form for it. Most of the sort of layout design decisions are, are made, I would say. But then again, the, um, the menu structure to, to consider, really stand out is going to vary according to the model of television. And also any customizations that the user might wish to incorporate. So, um, one of the nice things about having an LCD and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it. Um, okay. I got product evaluation as well. Yeah, see I don't, some of these things kind of logically follow the others. How can product evaluation doesn't come after that's been seen? Are you product prototype? I think would be, yeah, no, it would be more a case of how do you envision us performing the product evaluation once we have a. Model to test with. Oh, that's the okay. So, um, so it would be a case of, do you think that just bringing users in to have them test out? Maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places, which I suppose is quite similar. Or just kind of hitting the streets and, you know, saying, this is a new remote control. What do you think it'll look at it? Okay, so, um, um, at this stage, we still have no, no target audience. I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say, maybe 60 or something will it address? Okay. Um, the reason I'm saying that is that we're just looking at a replacement remote control, something that's stylish. So maybe you're even just, maybe you're not around down your target audience simply by saying it's thirst. If they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then they've got a bit of free cash that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket. Maybe even single just for the reasons of, um, excess cash flow. Of course, I mean at 25 years, I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the, yeah, diverse as well as in normal bracket. Your idea of the USB would, I think, would largely depend on the cost. USB is definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there, but it might push the cost of the overall unit up because we require not just the connection, but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system. That one would have to be based on the US. The US paid for which? The idea was that maybe it could connect tops for, um, allowing a software interface and the PC for a larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice eating minimal design normally. Definitely talking some type of, but didn't they just say it's just for TV? It's just for TV, but for different programming it to use your TV, you might hook it up today. I'm not sure, but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of USB might be prohibitive. We don't know unless it would make sense to. But you're going to need some type of flash memory or something, but something that doesn't, you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the bad we did change. Yeah, you know, I mean, it would need to have, it would need to have, um, some sort of onboard memory anyway. For one, one thing because I do think the menus should be, um, although, you know, it's not going to be terribly complicated. It was just controlling one device, the menu system ought to be, um, ought to be customizable and different languages and different skills. How do you want to say the, um, the menu structure for looking through channels? If you've got lots of channels. If it was customizable as in different languages and stuff that does open, it is supposed to be international, right? It would make sense to. It would make sense to. And we better be careful that the time as well. We've already had five minute warning. Um, I would say, um, international would make sense. Um, you're going to look at product evaluation. I'm like, best heart rate up hell of a lot of crap. Um, you're going to look a bit more at the kind of physical makeup, you see, and looks like we're going to need it maybe a kind of prototype in play. We'll see how that goes. We're going to be supplied with the claims. Where is the claim? So, um, I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting, would you say? Yeah. Obviously we're going with the fashion thing, like, different, which is, um, spongy, smover. Yeah, I would say that would be my, I think I would largely actually clear the whole thing. But, um, but the spongy, I like it. You seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the river of rubber could be quite. Yeah. I do, I do, I mean, having, having bright yellow on this, but the moon would have options for colors as well. Yeah. And again, it has the advantages being harder to lose. Sure. I mean, we are trying to promote a remote control, but we want to keep the company brand as well. Yeah. So we always need to remember it's somewhere women to be getting this slogan on. Possibly, I'm not sure, but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area, which could be used. Like I said before, I think we should have the RR on the, on the top function button. Okay. And I think that says it all really. I'm going to go to it. Right. We'll see everybody in a half hour.
