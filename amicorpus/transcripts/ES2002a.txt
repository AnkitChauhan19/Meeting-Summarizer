 like you've already produced a PowerPoint. not actually what have some work. Attention. Okay. Right. Well, it's the kickoff meeting for our project. And this is just what we're going to be doing over the next 25 minutes. So, first of all, just to kind of make sure that we all know each other. I'm Laura and I'm the project manager. Great. Do you want to introduce yourself again? I'm David and I'm supposed to be a industrial designer. Okay. I'm Andrew and I'm a marketing expert. I'm Greg and I'm a hugeurante-face. Great. Okay. So we're designing a new remote control. And, oh, I have to record he's here actually. So, that's David, Andrew and Craig as much. And you all arrive, don't tell me. Yes, we're designing a new remote control. As you can see, it's supposed to be original trendy and user friendly. So, that's kind of our brief that we are. And so, there are three different stages to the design. I'm already sure what you guys have already received in your emails. What did you get? I just got the project announcement. I'm just going to be designing a new remote control. Yeah, that's that. So, everybody got, okay. So, we're going to have like individual work and then a meeting about it. And repeat that process three times. And at this point, you get to try out the whiteboard over there. So, you get to draw your favorite animal and sum up your favorite characteristics of it. So, who would like to go first? I don't go first. Very good. All right. So, this one here, right? Okay. All right. My favorite animal is like... How big of a go? The favorite characteristics of it? Is that right? Yeah. All right. Well, basically, high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family. And, yeah, they have lots of personality and be fit in robust good health. So, this is blue, blue beagle. I say I'm a big go. Right? Lovely. Well, if my favorite animal would be a monkey. And then the small cute and furry. And when plant needs becomes real, and when they up they with them. Thank you. You can take as long as this is you like, because we haven't got an awful lot to this business. What we do, we do. Don't feel like you're in a rush anyway. I could tell you a lot more about beagles. I could too. Well, I have to get you up again. I don't know. Mine is I'm going to have to think of a spot. Impressionist. Is that a whale? Yeah. Well, I don't know. It's just the first animal I can think of to top of my head. The biggest reason is because I'm allergic to most animals. I'm allergic to animal fur. Fish was natural, right? Yeah, and I kind of like wheels. I'm coming in the middle of it. Everything inside. And if I'm harmless and mild and interesting. Okay. I still don't know what I'm going to write about. Superbscatch, by the way. I was going to choose a dog as well. But I just draw a different kind of dog. My favorite animal is my dog at home. That doesn't really look like him actually. He looks more like a pig actually. I see a dog in there. Oh, that's very good of you. Now I see a rooster. What kind is it? He's a mixture of various things. And what did I put him? That's just a guess that his tail works. He's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you. Very kind of affectionate. And he's quite wee as well. So, you know, he doesn't take up too much space. And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail. This is quite amusing. Is he aware that this is his own tail? It is, I think it is. He only does it after he's had his dinner. And he just, all of a sudden, is get up and start chasing his tail. He's around the living room. Probably when he was little, he got lots of attention for doing it. It's forever been conditioned. Maybe. Where did you find this just down here? Maybe doing the next. Okay, I need to discuss the project finance. So, according to the brief, we're going to be selling this remote control for 25 euros. And we're aiming to make 50 million euros. So, we're going to be selling this one in international scale. And we don't want it to cost any more than 12-50 euros. So, 50% of the selling price. Can we just go over that again? Sure. So, basically, I don't know. Alright. So, production cost is... Oh, together. 12-50, but selling price is that wholesale or retail? Like, on the shelf? I don't know. I imagine that's a good question. I imagine it probably is, or sale, actually, because it's probably up to the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want. But I don't know. I mean, do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on highly designed at all? Yes. I think it will. And... Well, right away, I'm wondering if there's, like, the DVD players if there are zones. Oh, yeah. Regents and stuff. Freakancies or something? Yeah. Okay. As well as characters, different keypad styles and simple. Yeah. But for a work of control, do you think that would be... No. ...as a business depends on how complicated our work of control is? There's no sense when you've been designed to be a case... ...you have more complicated characters than you have in the industry and you have no money. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then the other thing international is on top of the price. I'm thinking the price might appeal to a certain market in one region, whereas in another it'll be different. Or just, like, in terms of the wealth of the country. Like, how much money people have this band on? Or just, like, basic product positioning. The 25-year-old remote control might be a big hit in London. Might not be such a big hit in Greece, you know? Yeah. I don't know how to say it's a big hit. Yeah. Market in? Yeah. Good market in the world. I should be writing all this time. Um... Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what information we're given here. Making K-Trendy probably means something other than just basic. Yeah. Something other than just standard. So I'm wondering right away, selling 25-years is that sort of that? Is this going to be like a premium product? Yeah, yeah, like how much does, you know, a remote control cost? Well, 25-year-old, I mean, that's, um... That's probably like 18 pounds or something, doesn't it? Or no, is it as much as that? 16, 17, 18 pounds. Yeah, that's it. Um... I don't know, I've never bought remote control, so I don't know how good a remote control is. I don't know how good a remote control that would get you. Yeah. Um... Yeah, I suppose it has to look kind of cool gimmicky. Um... Right. Okay. You just scoot on the head here. Okay. Um... Well, does anybody have anything to add to the finance issue at all? Do you have any other background information on, like, how that compares to other... No, actually, that would be useful, wouldn't it, if you knew, like, what your money would get you? No. Hmm. Yeah, interesting thing about discussing the production of remote control for me is that, as you point out, I just don't think remote control is being something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits. Yeah. It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something. Five minutes to end of meeting? Ooh, okay. We're a bit behind. You know what I mean? Yeah. Is there, like, how do you... I mean, one way looking at it would be, well, the people producing television sets, maybe they have to buy remote controls. Another way is maybe people who have TV sets are really fed up with their remote control, and they really want a better one or something. My parents want to buy remote controls because they got fed up by having, or if I had different remote controls, which... Right. Right. And the panel was just... How many devices is a control? Right. And the function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses. Right. So do you think that should be like a man designing a remote control? I think so. Do your satellite and your regular tally and your VCR and everything? Well, like maybe what we could use as a sort of like an example of a successful other piece of technology is pom-pilots. They're going from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras, MP3 players, telephones, everything agenda. So like, I wonder if we might add something new to the remote control market, such as the lighting in your house, or... Or even, you know, notes about what you want to watch, like you might put in there, or I want to watch that in touch and look at it. And that's a good idea. So extra functionality. And like personally for me at home, I've combined the audio, video of my television set, and my DVD player, and my CD player. So they all work actually function together, but I have different remote controls for each of them. So it's sort of ironic that they're in there. You know, they sound and everything. It's just one system. But each one's got its own little... Okay. I'm going to have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes. I'll just check with nothing else. Okay. So anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like, about remote controls they've used, what they would really like to be part of this new one. It's all... You keep losing them. You keep losing them. Okay. You get these ones where you can... If you like whistle or make really high pitched noise, they beep. Yeah. I mean, is that something we'd want to include, you think? I'm sure. Okay. I remember when the first remote control my family had was on a cable. Actually, the cable between the TV and big buttons that's on a blender or something. I get that. And I think about what they are now is better, but actually it's still kind of a massive junky thing on the table. Maybe we could think about how it could be more streamlined. Maybe like a touchscreen or something. Something like that. Or whatever would be technologically reasonable. It could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better. But that just the appeal of... It's better. I've not having, you know, these days, every... People's things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic, you know? Yeah. Nice or material. Okay. Might be. Okay. The worst exploring. Right. Well, so we just to wrap up. The next meeting is going to be in 30 minutes. So that's about 10 to 12 by my watch. So in between nine then, as the industrial designer, you're going to be working on, you know, actually working design of it. So you know, you're doing there. And for our user interface technical functions, I guess that's, you know, like what we've been talking about, what it'll actually do. And marketing executive, you know, be just thinking about what it actually, what, you know, what requirements it has to fulfill. And we'll get instructions emailed to you, I guess. Okay. And... Yeah, so it's the functional design stage is next. I guess. And... And that's the end of the meeting. So I've got the little message. A lot of seniors I thought I would. Before we wrap up, just to make sure we're all on the same page here. Do we, we're given sort of an example of a coffee machine. All right. Well, are we right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television? Or are we keeping sort of like a design commitment to television features? Okay, well, just very quickly because it's supposed to finish. No. I guess that's up to us. I mean, you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it. Okay. So, you know... In fact, they would be... Okay. Yeah. The cap there, sure. Okay. It depends on how much you can climb into that pipe. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Rye's okay. Well, that's the end of the meeting then. Thank you all for coming. Could I hit that with what they wanted to do? Isn't it? Rye? Great. How do you turn this thing off? Is it function and... Ah, there we go. It's smooth. I think if you can just leave it on maybe and then... Oh, God, this has turned itself off. I'll try to keep it in. I'll turn it in. Yeah. Beep, beep. Oh, there it is. Oh, there it is. Oh, there it is. Okay. Okay. Nice. You all very like that. Yeah. And leaving. Yeah. Okay. I think it actually looks so much easier. Okay. Are you Are you. Okay. There is. But still. Okay. We have to go. One more shot and switch. Okay. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I'm going to go to the next slide. I don't know. I don't know how to speak to people. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I wouldn't expect to know if I'm...
