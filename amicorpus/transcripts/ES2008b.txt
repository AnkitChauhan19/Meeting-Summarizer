 Good to see you all again. Let's see if that can be done. This is our functional design meeting. Okay. We put the fashion in electronics. Okay, our agenda today. Just took time. It's 12.13. I'm going to do an opening. Talk about, did you all get the minutes? I emailed them to you. I'm also putting them in the shared folder. So, we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations. I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received. And then we have to make a decision on our route control functions. Finally, we'll just close. We're starting this meeting at approximately 12.13 and we have 40 minutes. First of all, the functional design objectives. We need to keep in mind the user requirements specification, what needs and desires are to be fulfilled. Detectional functions design, what effect the apparatus should have, and the working design. How the apparatus actually works to fulfill its function. Okay, three presentations. You can go in any order you choose. Should we go in the order that you just did it? Sure. Please do. I don't know. How do I hook my screen up? I think you might have to discus it. Yes, Rose. It's a function effect. Blue one, that thing. Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in? How wait, it's burned. I think you just have to push it in really hard. Oh, got it. I'm going to attach it to anything. There you go. I don't know if you guys are able to get access to the report that was online or if I'm going to put it on there. I don't know how to play this. Press the little presentation. It looks like a Y kind of over there above draw. There you go. Right. We're going to talk a little bit about functional requirements that people specified when they were asked. I guess real reaction did some market research. They were asked to use the word subject into their usability lab and they watched TV and recorded the frequency that they use particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had. What they found was they analyzed people's desires and needs. People specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly. 75% of the 100 subjects noted that and that they more importantly though 80% said they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote. I don't know anything beyond what fancy means but that's particularly of use to us I think. Also, they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age. So younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition whereas the older people in the like 60 and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognition. People also had certain frustrations that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design. That being people frustrated with losing their remotes I think over 50% of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration. People were also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons it just needs to be easy to use. It also mentioned something called RSI and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what RSI is. I don't know. What? There we go. People did not like that sort of the carpal tunnel type thing. People did not like that. The repetitive use I guess caused a strain. Looking at the needs people specified. The problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behavioural. They are using 10% of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote. What people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume. People also zap, like change the channel, about 65% during an hour of use. We really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings, the screen settings and the channel settings because they are used much more and frequently and probably complicate what's going on. I think that something that we might want to think about. The idea of an LCD screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were. I don't know if that's coming to me later. I wasn't like that but something for us to consider. There are also just the phenomenon that lasts more when it comes to the buttons on their remote or what we want to make easiest to use. Make sure that something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on their remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often. Basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly. It feels like the way they're going to use it so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that. Thank you very much. That was great. Let's move on to the next presentation on effects. You? Great. You have a button to spare that? The user interface, right? I think that's in the shared if I did it right. If anyone wants to look at it, I'm going to put it in the video. Okay. I'm going to talk about the technical functions design of the remote control. I need to start by considering what a remote control actually is. It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television. So it's basically communication device. We tell the remote control what we want to do. It sends a message to the television saying change the channel, change the volume. Yeah, I just need to set it. How do we actually go about designing any television remote control? The first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications. We need to know what our final product is going to be like. So we need a clear idea of exactly what this product does, how it works, and what the end user is going to want to do this product. A way I'd suggest that we could go about this by designing several different prototypes to use of interfaces for this product. And then trying to get some feedback about how well these particular prototypes work. So by now what people think of them using a remote control is quite a subjective experience. And different people, different things. We should remember that remote controls are a fairly standard piece of equipment when it uses using a remote control. The computer expects the buttons to be in certain places. So in some sense we're going to have to aim for the device which is very conventional in design. So we're not completely shocking people. But I think within that there is also been just to introduce novel ideas and to make something that's perhaps a little bit different from some of those things out. Also in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities. The first of these is technological. What can we do with the current state of technology as it is? The second is economic. We need to find the balance between features and files. So as you mentioned things like waste recognition would add to the files. But it would also include the design of the products. So I have a look on the web to see if I can find a few examples of existing television and remote control. In analyzing these we can consider what things are good about them, what things do they get like, what's bad about them, what's wrong with them, how we can improve on the designs that are found. And what can we do to make up on that stand out from the large majority of the remote controls? Here's two examples, probably the extreme ends of the spectrum. On the left here we've got an engineering based design but remote control. So it's one that's got lots of buttons, it's fully featured. Everything you might possibly want to do is there. It's got forward backwards, up, down, channel numbers, volume, these things. It's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it. But once you've learned it, you can do whatever you want with your TV. The one on the right is a lot more basic. It's just got the essential functions of the TV, changing the channel, place, lock, volume. It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it. But again, it swings in and out of the bounce. The disadvantages you can't use it. It's a great way to freeze the television picture. There's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control. So we've got to find a way of striking the balance between the two. As I said before, the very controlled house objective, different people want different things. Personally, what I want to know about remote control is a device that's simple. It's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often, changing the volume, changing the channel. It does everything that I need it to. As I said before, I'm quite lazy. I don't want to walk across the beam just to adjust my television. I also want something that looks cool and that feels like this ergonomically designed. Thank you very much. That was very useful. It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes. Neither of them were very pretty. I think that could be our selling point. Fashion, fashion, the mode. Right. There's a certain market technology that looks cool. That's my company's app movement. I really can't see what I'm doing. There it is. Showing up already? Did it let you go on the internet? That was just funny. I was like, you're going in and I'm like, wait, I'm going to walk. All right. No, how do I play again? It's right above draw. It's with bottom. It's the one that looks like a desk. This is our working design presentation. I'm going to do some issues with this because I wasn't able to find everything I needed. But I guess that's, we're still in early stages. This is this. The thing about working design is what we're trying to do is working designers figure out how the apparatus can fulfill its function. One of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder. It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans. Then put the beans through a filter and that filters out. Then you get coffee at the end. That's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then other things that are brought in to make it work. I don't know if I'm explaining that very well, but how do I get to the next? The method as working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfill this practical function. What needs to be done and how do we convert all elements to make that done? The easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen. You make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted towards this practical function. Then I think the easiest thing to do is going to be work on each task separately. You just press the edge of the neck. The findings that I got very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver. In my opinion, infrared is the best way to do that because you don't need a sight line. That's one thing we're going to work on. The user interface is critical here because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that converts the electrical energy into data. The chip that I think Ian is designing is going to be crucial. It all comes down to the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design. The components that we find here are the energy source, the battery, or whatever that's going to make it work. Then the chip, which converts the data, the user that's controlling the chip, and the infrared bulb that's going to let us move the data to the receiver. So you have four main components. They are designed sort of like this. You have your energy source right there, which then brings energy or information to the chip, which is also controlled by the user. So you have energy going to the user who is controlling the chip. That's not what I want to do. Use that thing down that you can go back. Previous. Sorry about that, guys. Oh, no, no, no, no. Okay, let's just get back to my skin out of care. Double click on it with the left hand one. Yeah, I am. I think it's frozen. Don't show me that. There we are. Sorry about this, guys. I'm kind of pathetic with things like this. All right. So you have your energy source, your user interface, who is controlling the chip. The chip also uses the energy, and the chip through the use of the user interface is going to control the switch, which will work your infrared bulb, which will then bring the data to the receiver. So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way. This is the parts of the working design that need to be figured out. And personal references, besides the fact that I can't spell, we need a long lasting energy source. People don't want to be changing it a lot. We need a chip that works well with the user interface that isn't too complicated. We have straightforward interface like Ian was saying, simple, not overwhelming it with information. And we need a reliable and clear infrared signal so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands. That's pretty much it for the working design. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Most do you think you can give me a hint with this? Yes, absolutely. Can I never tell you where to turn these things? Lefty Lucy, righty, tidy, righty? Lefty Lucy, righty, tidy. Never heard of it. Oh, yes. I think about every time. It's a good one. It's a good deal. Nothing on my screen. There we go. Lucy, yes. Requirements. We have a couple of new requirements that I was just emailed right before the meeting that we have to keep in mind as we're creating this. We didn't bring it up yet or at all in the meetings so far, but we're not going to work with teletext because that's been taken over by the internet, so we're not going to worry about that. What was that? It's a precious thing. No. Would you care to explain it? I suppose it's kind of similar to a very basic reference. You have numbers that you can go. You type in the page number one, so you type 100 and you're like, you're drawing and this kind of index is on the television screen. You just type a sentence and you're working with graphics and you just have numbers and you're going to send it to your destination. Oh, no. You're asking about the number of things you do that you should have. You're asking about the numbers and the score scores. But if you ever see the TV saying, go to page 160 on CFACS now, that's what they're talking about. So it's put your own time limit. Okay, I just want to explain why. I have no idea why we don't have it, but let's go. Interesting. I'm going to, the man decided we're not going to work with that. Okay. And we're also going to, like your question earlier, whether this is going to be for television video or et cetera, just for television. That's what we're focused on. Otherwise, it becomes too complex. We want to get this out very quickly. We only have a short amount of time. And finally, this is more marketing. I think our corporate image has to be recognizable. So while we're going to make it look pretty, we need to use our color and our slogan in the new design. So what's our corporate image like? It's kind of yellow color. It looks like kind of a yellow and black and we have that, the emphasis on the Rs in. What's the number of? Yeah. We put the fashion and electronics. So we've got to keep that in that in mind. Okay. So we want something that looks good. Yep. And it's yellow. Yeah. Or maybe some buttons could be yellow. Like we can play around with it a little bit. Okay. We need to talk about our functions and our target group. We decide who our target group is. You, in your analysis of the marketing, you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences. For example, that older people didn't really care for voice recognition, but younger people did. So who are we ending this at? If we're going to say that function fashion, we put the fashion and electronics, then automatically I think sort of younger group that's who's going to be attracted to this. We have to think who's going to have the money to buy it. It's going to be 25 euro, remember. So it has to be marketable to whoever it is. Well, at least right now what we're doing is deciding on just the remote itself. So it will probably be sold separately. 25 euro by itself. The only breakdown that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation. And basically there's a big jump after 35 people don't really care if it has voice. So it's basically 15 to 35, but I think that's a good idea. I don't know if I'm going to be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later, but if that's the only quality that we have that is divided into age, then we would want to stick between the 15 to 35 range. That's probably a population of quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway. So that might be a fairly good target group for us. Now, those are that's all specific for speech recognition. Are we going to use that as one of our functions? I would say no, especially if we are marketing. But I would say that we are going to be doing a kind of good thing. But I would go by the limit and do 12, 12, and a half years. To produce it? To produce it, yes. I wouldn't even go and get a place that the measurement would have been 12, and a half years. I would have nothing to do with other companies. But what else are we going to put? I mean, not that I'm really going to hold about it. I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though. So like other than just making it look good, how is it? I mean, it can look really great and still have the same up and down button in the mind than we're going to buy a new remote. Well, but why are we aiming for a technological advancement? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple, and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology. I think they could use lines. They could mean not. If they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology. If someone's looking to buy a new remote, don't they want like an upgrade? I don't know. Upgrade, well, we can look at Upgrade or we can look at user friendly. Yeah, simplification. It could have a crapper mode that came with our TV that's just impossible to use. Or maybe it broke or maybe they're just missing it. And we also need to talk about if we're only going to have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow. Or, I mean, this might be too complicated, but I wish I had some mind to explain it. If it was just a simple either the sphere of the spray that had the main buttons and then you could pull something out kind of and you got the rest of the buttons but the rest of them went in. Do you know what I'm saying? They were going to pull out of the side. Some TVs that have a small screen, normally they're like normal, but lines will be complicated. So you want to do something complicated, like on some of those you know the two, and you're open up this little hatch, you're only going to slide down and that's the best. Because then like people who don't want to ever look at them never even have to see them. And if you get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it, then you'll never even know that those things can pull out. And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes, one that has the easy ones and one that has more complicated ones. That's a good idea. It's all so in one. We have to be careful that that doesn't impede the chip transmitting information. Yeah. But that's going to be mostly a technological thing. Okay, so what are we emphasizing in this project? In the beginning, we're going to be focusing on the ability and fashion. Okay, those are very good goals, I think, that we have to keep in mind with everything we do. Simplicity and fashion and, or usability, however you want to say that, which includes an emphasis on making the infrared very functional, so that you don't have to travel around a lot. What can you do to make the infrared more functional? Like why would it not be? I think it's a lot to do with battery, but that's just my battery. And that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well without sort of scattering. So it's just the quality of a chip. Yeah, I think so. The quality of all the components really, I mean, we can't really do anything. Shall we work? It's going to be visible down the line. So our target group, we're saying 15 to 35? Well, I don't know how useful that number is if we're not doing voice recognition. Yeah. Which I kind of, I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in our remote control. I don't know. Like it might be necessary for a TV, but not for the remote, you know, seems a little bit. Yeah, and it might be too expensive. And if you had a whole idea of using a remote, then why would you have a voice? Like, you know, it's like you would need a remote, you would just talk to your TV. Yeah. Oh. Ultimately, I think people are not going to be bothered to talk to the right people. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe, I mean, if I get more numbers, I'll email you before the next meeting in terms of age as. But this doesn't divide up anything. And there was only 100 subjects also. Which isn't, I mean, really, it's not representative, especially if it's 100 subjects. So that they then can subdivide into age groups. That means there's very few in each age group. I think regardless, we're aiming for the under 65 or something under 65. Okay, that's a good start. I'd say where, can we narrow down to maybe teenagers and families? Because that would go up to like 50 professionals or something. I think you'd go like 55. Yeah, it's hard to narrow down. I don't think you're out right now. I think the problem is, it's not built across the board by a generation. And we said simplicity is one of the features. So it's going to appeal to people. Maybe people who have problems with technology, they don't really get that. Okay. And that might be older people. But then we've also got passion, which is something that definitely is. Well, maybe we don't have to define this hard group by the demographic of age. Maybe we could define it by the demographic of how much money they have to spend or something like that. That's a good one. Obviously, that's to be someone who owns the television. And how recently have they bought the television? That sort of thing. So maybe it's more useful to just find objectives. Like, passion, simplicity, then to find specific target group as far as age. Because things will appeal to different people. Okay. Oh, there are a couple of functions. Do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost? Like a button on the TV, you can press in it or ring or something. I don't know, like, or beep. I guess I before 50% of the frustration someone could have that was the biggest one. And half people said that happened. And we all mentioned it before. We knew about it. And if we're talking about making something easy, that sort of goes along with it. So it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in. It would be relevant like the overall goal. Yeah. That's probably good. Okay. We have about four minutes left to define our functions. So let's do that quickly. So we want something to keep it from getting lost. Yeah. And we want... We want large buttons for the essential things. Yeah. Large, accessible buttons for the essentials. We want a possibility to get... Possibility to get the extra functions. Yeah. Which kind of fit in the way in some way. We're not hidden. We're not as prominent as the main features. Yeah. Hidden way. And we also want it to be fashionable. Which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a... Yeah. So I wanted to think I'm in coffee table. It's not like an ISO or that kind of thing. Yeah. Okay. Do any other essential functions that we need? Battery? Do we need a long life battery use? Yeah. I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really. But we never have between the batteries. Yeah. We should play very well. We should play very well. But we need a battery use. I suspect that we might be able to buy a battery. I would imagine just because it is an electronic device. I think it does. I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without one. But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone. Or like a little cradle for your iPod. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That might contribute to less people losing it too. It stays one place. I have to think about space in the living rooms too. Would you put it on top of the TV? I don't know. Okay. That's a good idea. We'll keep it. Let's just off the top of the head. It will be fun. Okay. Okay. We're going to conclude now. As everyone said, their functions. Okay. After the meeting, we're going to each complete questionnaire in the summer's summary. I don't know what summerization. And then we'll have our launch break. After that, we have 30 minutes of individual work. I'll make sure to put the minutes in the project documentation and including this PowerPoint slides. If everyone could do that as well, that would be great. You each have individual actions. I, ID, industrial design. If your components concept, user interface, the user interface concept, market trend watching. And as per last time, you'll get specific instructions from your personal coach emailed to you. And hopefully, I hope next time you'll be able to access more of the website that they seem to tell you that you could. Yeah. It's kind of frustrating. You sure to note any frustrations or any issues that come up in your, in your, um, summary. Okay. Okay. That sounds good. Great to know. That's good. That's good. Did you, um, were you able to, like, put yours in the group folder? Yes. I just did that. Hopefully it is there for people. Yep. Yeah. Looks like there are, um, looks like there's a second one kind of of mine. Yeah. That I do. It's from like an earlier project, I think. So, okay. Um, where is that? Under the shared folder. I don't know. It might not even be under your. So in there, we have technical functions, presentation, working design, presentation, and the functional requirements. At least that's why I have three. I just have like R three. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I have as well. Oh, you don't have mine. No, but that's because I think yours is in the email separately. Like it's not on the server. Yeah. Hmm. But if I open it and then save it, probably will be there. I'll wait and I'll remind you can't save. Okay. Well, I'll figure that out in the meantime. Okay. Okay.
