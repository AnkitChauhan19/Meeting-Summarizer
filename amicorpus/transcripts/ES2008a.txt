 I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. Okay, good morning, everybody. I'm glad you could all come. I'm really excited to start this team. I'm just going to have a little PowerPoint presentation for us for kick off meeting. My name is Rose Lundgren. I'll be the project manager. Our agenda today is we're going to do a little opening and then I'm going to talk a little bit about the project. Then we'll move into a quaintance just getting to know each other a little bit, including a tool training exercise. And then we'll move into the project plan and then we'll move into the project plan I know we'll move into the project plan, do a little discussion, and close since we only have 25 minutes. First of all, our project aim. We are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about. It needs to be original, trendy, and user-friendly. I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those. So we're going to divide this up into three parts. First, the functional design, which will do an individual work, come into a meeting, the conceptual design, individual work, and a meeting, and then the detailed design, individual work, and a meeting. So that will each be doing our own ideas when coming together and collaborating. Okay, we're going to get to know each other a little bit. So what we're going to do is start off with a MENA, Alima, sorry, Alima. We're going to do a little tool training. So we're going to work with that whiteboard behind you. Introduce yourself, say one thing about yourself, and then draw your favorite animal and tell us about it. Okay. Which one of those I have to bring with me? Probably both. I'm supposed to draw my favorite animal. I have no drawing skills whatsoever. But let's see, introduce myself. My name is Alima, which is in T.M. I'm from the state of Maine in the U.S. I'm doing Nationalism Studies. I have no artistic talent. How do you spell your name? I am A. Oh, and I guess I'm the industrial designer on this project. Let's see if I can get here. I will draw a little turtle for you all. It's not necessarily because it's my absolute favorite animal, but just that I think there's a drawable. You have the pretty little shell going on. Can you find Happy? There you go. It's a turtle. So what are your favorite characteristics? I like the whole heaven of shell thing. It's quite cool. Carry your home around where you go. Quite decorative little animals. They can swim. They're very adaptable. They carry everything they need with them. And they're easy to draw. Excellent. So you just go around the table? I go for an NZ. These are in space for the budget. I'm trying to hold my finger up. I should leave that one on that. No, you can erase the turtle itself. It might be nice to have them all up there at the same time. I'm not going to draw it quite this time. Is that a reason why that's not around? It's not real. It's real. Oh my God, that is an amenable tool. Yeah, the reason I like my house is because what that's called, I quite intelligent. And that kind of mistakes. We don't really know much about them. And I understand how they work. I can't control my contraptions with these. All right, I'm Jeffy. I'm from around DC, I just sort of in the US. And we're going to keep the deep sea sort of theme going on. Are there animals? Don't really know how to draw this. I'm going to draw this. Can you get rid of the water? Help. Sort of give an idea. I have no idea how one would explain this. I'm going to get some whiskers. Basically it's supposed to be a seal. You can imagine it in the water. I like them because they're like playful and silly sort of. Have a good time. I'm not going to try them for time. It can get me better than that. I'm Rose and I'm project manager from California. I'm going to try to draw this. I'm going to draw this. I'm going to draw this. See. It's definitely significantly harder once you're doing it. It's actually a coyote. Let's see. Give it a little bit of a snout. Is it over it, Ross? Just the cute snout? That's pretty impressive. I will all the time. So I really enjoy their singing and their really beautiful animals. Okay. Moving on to slightly more serious stuff. I'm going to talk about project finances. We have a couple. We'd like to sell it for about 25 euro with a profit aim of 50 million euro from all our sales. Because this is such, this is for television, it's a, we have a market range of internet, like it's an international market range. We don't have to worry about specifics. In order to make a profit of this magnitude, we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of 12, 50 euro. So we're selling it for twice. What we'd like to produce it for. Okay. Just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project, I'd like to hear about your experiences using remote controls. Your first idea is about creating a new remote control. What would be the best that you, what are the features that you really like, what are the features that you don't like, etc. I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the TV like you have to do one foot power of the TV and then like another one to get the actual screen on and anything else to get it all going. I don't know. Now they keep combining all different remote together and I don't know if I necessarily like that because I feel like you end up like multi-media overload. I just want to watch the TV. I always get fast. I'm sort of like devised to help you find it. I do. I do like because it's like TV and the TV player and it's a little bit harder. I guess that we need to get up and move fast. I think that's especially if you're someone really lazy like me. I find that they can be annoying especially a watch TV. I have a tablet that can hold one foot in the TV, one foot in the digital box, one foot in the digital world. I also make data. I think that we've been using a lot of buttons on them. It's just complicated. All I really want to do is switch on and off. Change the channel, change the volume. Yeah. I agree with having too many remote surround. My dad has a whole drawer at home of remote sort of various things. I don't know how to work half of them. What's important for me, I guess, is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons. They're not too small. I need to know what you're doing. One thing I particularly like is if you're not sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infrared here. I think there's a way around that, but I know in my residence right now that the television you have to walk all around the room to turn on. It's just simpler to just turn around the TV itself. If you're going to make a remote control, it should actually work for what it's doing. There's about batteries and things like that. Are there some remote that don't require batteries or do well remote require batteries? I would imagine all of them, but it's also we could use a lithium battery that would last a lot longer than like double A's. Those are the batteries that are used in a lot of MP3 players now. That kind of thing. It seems we have a little bit of a conflict over combining all the remote together versus having five different remote. You said you don't like having all the buttons on one remote and yet you don't want to have five remote. How do we work with that? Could we get something that just has, you know, doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or programs, other things that I'm not very coherent about, but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything. You know, volume control on off, channel changing. Maybe that spatially divides it. So it's like if you're looking, if you're trying to get the TV on, that's, you know, like the top thing on their remote. I don't know if it would be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're going to make it. But if it's like all the TV stuff is here, then all the DCR stuff is here, all the, whatever else you have programmed into it. It's all just in its separate place and that's like all the on buttons together. Because then you're like, I don't even know what I'm turning on. Yeah. And if you'd save the more complicated functions, maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day. Okay. So maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on off, channel changing volume, and another remote remote with all the special things. Because that is one thing that, um, remotes tend to have buttons that the TVs no longer have as well. So like you have to have them somewhere because you're going to need those special functions occasionally. But not necessarily on the normal. Yeah, it's going to be like control, the television. Good question. And if this device is just to be used for the television, would we even technically be possible to get the microphone in there? I don't know that yet. It's just the, just the television, television, television, that you might be following. It's a good question. I'll look into it. I think it's just TV. I mean, if it's ever taking it, just write it sad. New product, a new television or remote control. It's not like, you know, I wouldn't say, you know, think it might be more advanced than that. So we should, we should be seeing that it's just the television that they want to be. Well, I suppose it would be nice to have the volume recording stuff like that in the video that they're doing. I don't know, I'm like setting it up to be on it. So I guess we have to define what we're aiming for. If it's just a television, then that's a bit simpler because there's less buttons that would even need to be on it. Yeah. It's an idea that the buttons being available and large. Yeah. If you have older people or people like me that aren't very coordinated, hand-eye. It's really quite important that you're not pressing a small, like, teeny mobile phone size buttons if we can help it. Okay. Okay. Sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas. Might if we move on. Okay. Now our next meeting starts in 30 minutes. I believe we've actually been only working on this one for about 20. So we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like. But this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually. The Industrial Design, Alima. We'll be doing the working design. Use your interface designer. That's for you. The technical functions, I guess, like keeping in mind the buttons, the size of the buttons. Use your requirements. So you'll be hearing about different trends, about different things that people need. I guess kind of the same discussion that we've been having. We'll get from actual consumers. Okay. And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach. We did a lot of analysis in this past when we didn't have much. We just wanted to get a little brainstorming done. So, very excited to see all your animals. And how wonderful artists we all are. Any questions? I haven't gotten an agenda yet. I'll put that together. I'm sure as we'll each get our own instructions. Because what we're going to do is first our individual actions. And then we'll come back together. I'm sure we'll have more concrete things to contribute next time. I'm sure we'll be busy. Okay. I'll type up the minutes and probably email those out to all of you. Just including all the things that we talked about. Yes, I think I can. I'll just attach it to an email. And your number two, two, three, four, is that correct? All right. It was lovely meeting you all. Just make sure to keep checking the company website and the emails. And we'll see if I can do that right now.
