 Excellent. So I sent you the agenda that was on the project document. I don't know if you've got a chance to just have a look at it. Anyway, the meeting is going to follow more or less the same structure as last time. So we'll go around each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to. And at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts. So that's we need to know about the components, properties, materials, the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching. Okay. Do you understand? Okay. It's got 40 minutes. So I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation. Yeah, I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead. Okay. So basically I'll start off by I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options. And what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are more highlighted underlining them or something like that. Okay. So I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anywhere. A brief introduction to the insights of a mode control and then we can probably discuss the various components. Yeah. Okay. So what you see here is this is the outside of the remote. Right. If you open it, you have a circuit board here. Right. And this is the chip that I was talking about last time. This basically sends information to a transistor here, which then sends the information to an LED device here. If you flip the printed circuit board and this is the most important point here, everything else is kind of. So if you flip the circuit board, this is what it looks like. So you see, for example, a particular button attaches to a particular place on the PCB. Yeah. And on pressing this button, I circuit completes the information goes to the chip, which is somewhere here. And the chip that then translates the code into an infrared radiation, which goes out through there. So the important point that I read over the website was that the configurations of these printed circuit circuits are quite. You can get them printed as you want to. So we can have a configuration irrespective of the cost, the way we want to have it. Right. So that's the important point here. So these are the different options that we have. Okay. So the batteries, I'll start with the battery. Right. So they can be simple, which is like the normal batteries in our results. Yeah. These are the kind of kind of batteries that the company makes. So hand dynamos. Is that like a wind up one? Yeah. I don't know if even if you want to consider this, but these are the different things that the company makes. So they'll, since they'll come internally from the company, they'll be cheaper all these options. So the third one is the kinetic energy one. You can make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike and then you could exercise walls, watching TV and charging the element. Yeah. And still worrying about the whole RSI. That's a good option. So what was the kinetic energy one is that usually in modern watches, since our hand keeps moving, it keeps the watch ticking. But I don't know if it is a good idea for a remote control because it will just lie there for a long while sometimes. As soon as you pick it up, it moves and then again it recharges or something. And the fourth option is the solar cells, which are also environment friendly. Okay. So I'll enlist things and then we can come back and discuss what we think from a very pretty perspective. There are different cases that can be provided. They can be basically the shape of the cases. They can be flat. They can be curved with one sided curved and one side flat. And they can be curved with on both the sides. These are the three options. I mean this would be like they were all shape of the remote control. They can be flat on both the sides. It would be curved from one side. There were different kind of supplements available. Like it can be plastic, rubber, wood or titanium. Okay. Did you say wood? Wood? Wood. Yeah, you understand why we get to purpose. Okay. So we can use even so titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment. So it's kind of it'll be probably nicer to use because it relates to the overall image of the company. It cannot be used on a double curved surface. If we choose this, we cannot use titanium for these two. We can use titanium, wood, rubber or plastic. Okay. The interface options now. So we can have push buttons like most remote to and our company is an expert in making push buttons. We can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointer. Yeah, something like that. And they can even have an integrated push button inside the scrolling. The scroll plus push. This is something that has been recently developed by the company in the last decade. So not two recent. And LCDs. We can have all CDs. These two are recent. And this is quite old. The various electronic options are. So this concerns first of all the chips. I showed you that. So there's a chip behind this one, right? The PCB is inexpensive. So we can put in whatever we want. But the various integrated circuit options are. We have either a simple one. Or a regular. Or advanced. And the price goes up. So we go down. Okay. So the good thing about why we would want to use advanced. Why we might want to use advanced is that LCDs can only come with the advanced chip. We need regular or advanced for scroll wheels. And the chip basically includes the infrared center. Besides this in the electronics. Also the company has started making a sample center which did not explain what it was. But I'm guessing that. So they have a sample center and a sample speaker. So I'm guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like. You know, as soon as you press a button, it. It gives you feedback. One five or whatever. Yeah, on. And I don't know whether a simple center has to do something with voice recognition or not. But anyway, so these are the different options that we have. Okay. So that's that's basically now. I think that we can integrate. You know, the user interface and the marketing things in that. Keep taking out things from this and underlying things that are important. Excellent. Do you want to stay somewhere near the board so that if we need to? Yeah. You can sit down. But we might need to lay back. I have some PowerPoint. Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. These pens can give you cancer of the hand. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah, it should do it. Interface concept. Okay. To be honest, actually, I mentioned some some of the things which could fit under under this talk. This time, I mentioned them already in the previous talk. So, yeah, this time, I might not have them on the slides, but I can just mention them again. Okay. So I thought I would also include the definition of using interface. So it's the aspects of a computer system or program which can be seen by the user. And which the mechanism that the user uses to control his operation and input data. So this would include things like shape and size and buttons and voice recognition as well and color and so on. The method I employed this time was again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet. And then analyze them from the point of view of user friendliness and also whether their appearance was pleasant. And then this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product. So some findings. So in the case of many user interfaces, they are just so full of buttons that it's actually hard to find the ones you really want to use. And it's just confusing. It takes time to learn. Okay. So I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found. Okay. Some of them are here. Well, the picture is not very clear, but as you can see there are actually. Oh, sorry for that. Let's go back. Oh, please. So yeah, they are quite big and have many, many buttons. Actually, all these I personally prefer this one because it's the smallest and with, with least, with the smallest number of buttons as well. And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice. Okay. So let's carry on with this. So other findings. Some new things used. Some of them were mentioned already by our technical designer. Our own company has developed a new user interface. Wait, no, this is not the one. There is a, we can include voice recognition and it allows, it's possible to record 80 different voice samples on it. So this one was already mentioned, the LCD display. Another new development is a scroll button, which was also already mentioned. And our own manufacturing division has designed a new programmable speech, sorry, a speaker unit I guess it should be. And this means that it comes together with a voice recognition. But it's, once the gadget recognizes the voice of the speaker, there can be pre-programmed answer. For example, you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says hello and your name or whatever. I mean, this is also one of the new developments, we might consider if we wanted to. Can you go back for a second. Are you sure what this means, the spinning wheel with the LCD display? It's like the, like you said, no, the scroll button is a different thing. I have a picture, if you, just a moment, I'll show you. So I wasn't completely sure myself, but I think it's just like, it's a wheel. It's like not separate buttons. Look, this one here, but I'm not really sure whether you can really turn it around. It's like a press list or this. Maybe I part is like, you know how you have your mouse and you go around and it's kind of like that. And it's been around. So instead of going down, you just spin. You just go around and there's a bit weird at first, but it's actually very like fast. Like the wheels that click on the side, you get a much slower. So it's quite good if you're like searching quite a lot of stuff. I know if you're looking, you're going through the A to Z of your music and you're looking for something at T. Then it's a lot faster than the wheel, but you've got a lot less control over. Right, so I should include that here as well. Plus spinning. Yeah. Okay, and the personal preference is pretty much the same as last time. It has to be small, simple. Okay, we decided to include voice recognition. So the standards of the major buttons like gone off, the channels and then volume. And then there has to be menu on the screen. And I also saw if we want to fit small and nice. And actually I quite like the idea of a scrolling button for voice. Like on the movements or something. I think there is no reason why we can use something like this for the remote control. So yeah, that's it. Okay, straight to trends and then we can discuss it all at once. I can't hear you. I can't hear you. I can't hear you. If you two could both do that. Two. Two. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Cool. We'll search the inserts, come up with market trends. And what users are going to be wanting in the near future. Okay. Right? No, the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect. Which is twice as important as the third aspect. So I mean the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the, given the target group is what you would expect. You know, people want something new, something technologically innovative and different. So the whole idea with the LCDs and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like, quite the thing to go for. And yeah, it wants to look frankly. So maybe as you're discussing things, is it okay if we just keep highlighting things here? So, so we're on the internet. So it's probably voice recognition is kind of important. Maybe the LCD and spin-in. Yeah. I have point about LCD. LCDs are basically for feedback to the user who is pressing buttons. And the feedback can come through the television itself. Do we need an LCD on the remote? I've asked you television runs really good. You've got one of those tele-west boxes. And you port the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to TV and then you wait and then it comes. So it actually takes quite a long time. But if you get the number wrong and it's a bit of a pain. So I think a screen on the remote would probably get down any time and that. But like the roads do tend to get thrown out of it. It is also quite nice though to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen. That's true. It would be like if you could make it integrate with the TV then it could come up with your information about what's on. And you could just see that on the remote rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure. But I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to have your mobile phone. You know, like you have the slide you want and you have the flip you want. And then the screen is protected so it doesn't actually get scratched. So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control. Or like a minimalist remote control. You've got your buttons one to nine, you're on and off. And you're volume on that. And then if you want to mess about it, you flip it open. And yeah. So we seem to have a consensus that LCDs are definitely the way to go because of style. Yeah, so that kind of decides your whole chip thing. Right. You agree? Yeah. Yeah. Right. So. OK. LCDs. Definitely. OK, apparently, the food and vegetables will be providing inspiration. So I just give it a heart. So these will be an important feature for clothes, shoes and furniture. So I mean, I'm taking this to mean, you know, carvenous. Do you know, because you don't tend to get flat vegetables. Yeah, possibly even, I mean, even. Yeah, a bit of asymmetry and stuff. But that would be a good way to get in the whole RSI issue in there. Because I mean, if you think most people use the mokkatole with their right hand, right hand, so you want to you carve it so that it's suitable for you to do it. Right hand. Yeah. I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy. Something a bit squishy. Yeah. Yeah, we have it. It could be like a rubbery. Yeah, rubber. But this is just with using. I suppose you would get a right hand. And it would help if you drop it. It protects it as well. Yeah. Yeah. So if we use latex cases, they won't allow us to use solar cells as an emergency. So we could use titanium, wood or plastic. Or if we want to use the latex, then we have to go with one of the other. Yeah, we're sure. We're sure. We'll get the kinetic energy fairly easily. From the different depth. Yeah. We could have a little board. Yeah. So probably double curved surfaces is the way to go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or curved at one end and flat on the top. Because I'm not sure if it is flat on both sides. Then how much easy would it be to reach for buttons etc. Yeah, tell us and I'll let the flatness out. Yeah. It depends on the whole. So I think it's like how you put your hammer so you can release it in the middle. Single side curve or double side curve does not say too much does it. No, I don't think it makes a lot of difference. I have one of those slightly fiends and I mean the back is essentially straight, but it's curvy. So besides the other four sides to a thing. I think so. So I mean, one side means one side is straight. Right. And curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curve. Did it say anywhere in your research material about this lighting stuff? Because I call it the intuition that I have, I think, the only options that we have with the cases are the EC3. Yeah. Either you have a flat surface to the case or a curved surface case. It does not say anything about whether technically this stuff is available at all. But this is more about the protection of the LCD which I think is what I carry on. My research didn't tell me anything which is why we have all the pictures. That I have to do with my time. Okay. Cool. We got. Combined style with a level of functionality, beauty and price quality. And the thing is, function. Okay. Yes. So looking at what we've got. We want an LCD display with a spinning wheel. Let's try to rub off things. Yeah, rub off some of those. So hand animals are definitely out. You are aware of that. That's not streamlined and sexy having a wind up. Kanata Kanata just seemed to have some kind of a appeal. But. It's about the practicality of a really easy technique. As against a watch which constantly keeps moving, this thing will have to be tapped every time which might be very frustrating for the user. Depends how much. How much. Movement really needs. I don't know if they're suggesting it. Then what could you do? Okay, let's keep it off. The flat completely flat case is definitely out. We know. It has to be at least uproar from one side. Okay, we still have all the options. Would you think would? I can't. How do you? I mean, you can't keep it really small. You can't make it like thin and. Right. The wood thing because you need to put all the technology in. So I mean, if the case, you add the case. Yeah, if it is a bit bulky. If it is really thin, it's likely to break. It's much more. Yeah, given that we're looking at more spongy material preferences. Would think maybe rather all plastic is more. Wood's not very clean, I believe. That's true. It's not practical. I mean, it's right for a table but for a muconfoil, you know. And splinters and stuff. Yeah. Okay. What is that? It doesn't make any sense. Yeah, in the case of remote control, remote really. Yeah. Okay. Now for the really interesting stuff, the interface. Yeah. Right. So the push buttons is our expertise in the industry. But it seems to be out of trend. You know, nobody's. Yeah, but have some push buttons. I think for the channel numbers, you still need them. Would you? Yeah. Yeah. Right. If we have LCD displays that opens up a whole world, you know, if you have an LCD display, then you can stack almost everything on the LCD display. Yeah, but I think the LCD displays kind of, yeah, it's faster. And if we just, when we discuss that we might like this flipping open thing, then I mean, you can use it as a normal remote control. Yeah. But if you do want to use LCD, then you'll flip it open, but it's more time consuming. I think this is going back to the graph at the beginning. I made where, you know, the buttons, the people use all the time, you want buttons to them. Yeah. And everything else. Yeah. Many don't. So in the buttons we have, for the channels also, we have options. Do we enumerate everything from 0 to 9? Or do we have just a channel plus channel minus just one? No, no, no. I mean, we definitely need the numbers because it's otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels. Yeah. Do we need them as buttons? Or do we need them as LCD? On the LCD we can, you know, say buttons because it's, yeah. It is. So, I think the thing is, so if someone just wants to turn on the TV and put on a channel, then it should be easier to use. Yeah. Then any of them are made. And then if someone wants to, you know, change the contrast on the TV and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible. But, you know, I mean, most of the time, I mean, there's a limit to how much the biggest technique is. There's the biggest technique and it's been fiddling with the TV. I think it's the base, you know. Okay. So, buttons definitely, but shall we try to draw our... I think that's what you guys are going to do next. Now, okay. So, if we put down the key... Okay. So, components. Yeah, we want... What about the scrolling? Yeah, but I'm not completely clear. Yeah, about the spinning wheel. So, I think it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing. You cannot include everything in the spinning wheel. Just spinning and not scrolling. Yeah, I would say that the spinning goes at a higher speed to the scrolling wheel. So, you have to decide whether you, you know, you want to be going so fast or not. But, I mean, the thing with this hole, if you're planning on making out of rubber, on the basis that it's spungy, I'm not sure how well I scrolling wheel would work. But if you've got a flip thing, effectively, it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side, but you fold the wheel in half. Yeah, the spinning wheel tends to go to one side. That would be on one side. I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber. Yeah, I think so too. I mean, the case would be rubbed on the buttons. Or at the corner, as you just, the edges covered by rubber or something like that. Everything else in plastic or even titanium if you want to use it. Or maybe like interchangeable cases. Because I know, like, we're going back to iPods again, the whole spinning wheel. But I have like a, obviously, my iPods not made of rubber. Then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it. And I can change the colour, theoretically, to match my outfit. Right. Okay, so that gives us a more trendy look as well. Yeah, I think the spinning wheel is definitely very narrow. Right. Yeah, and we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway. That's right. Yeah, that's right. So rub that out. And colours can be provided with the case rather than... But we still need to think about the colour offer mode as such. Yeah, I think it was a requirement that we use. For the colours of our company, so would it be like yellow, grey and black or something? I guess. That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme. Bananas? Bananas? Yellow? Yeah, definitely. I mean, do you think we're giving corporate the colours of the company into the buttons? And then make the colours the main remote. The colour like vegetable colours, you know? So you could have like, I mean, I suppose vegetable colours would be orange, green, and some reds. And maybe purple and then you'd paint the buttons in company colours to that. Yeah. Okay. Okay. If you go over to the integrated circuits, since we are having LCDs, there's no way that we will be able to. What we do need to consider, however, is that the price is going up with every such thing that we are considering. But since LCDs seems to be a definite yes. So it seems to be one idea where we would want to spend. So I'll rub off the other two. So we discounting solar energy because rubbers going to be used in there somewhere. That was the constraint was... We can't have solar panels with rubber. So yeah, okay, so we lose that, I think. Should we go for... if we're going for rubber, we think of it as our case. And then... And the buttons as well, isn't it? Yeah. I think... Like, 5 more minutes. We'll have... Using simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one. I mean, although it does seem interesting, but it does not hold any advantages as well. Yeah, it's just a gimmick. Okay. Okay, so we understand this better now that the speaker is for the feedback, right? It says the things that you type in or something like that. I think if we can include them at not too much extra cost, then I'd put them in. We don't have too much information about it. Yeah, but I think it should be quite cheap because it's from the company. Okay, so this is in as well then. Yeah. So I'll push the curve. Okay. And the case is curved on one side, but then flat on the top. So it's flipped into each other. Okay. Can I pull the... Yeah, sure. Thank you, sir. Just so I can... Sorry, I just... Nothing gets right. What is ICIC? ICICs? Integrated circuits? So it's advanced integrated circuits? Yeah. Welcome to that. We're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as on CDs. Yeah. Okay. So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery, the advanced chip. And a curved on one side case, which is folded in on itself. Made out of rubber. And buttons are also rubber. We're having push buttons on the outside. And then on the inside and LCD with spinning wheel, we're incorporating voice recognition. That's how it will look. And it's going to look sort of vegetal. And be in bright, vegetable colours. So would we have the spinning wheel inside, with the LCD or would it be on the altar? Imagine it would be inside. Okay. Actually that kid really cut down your thing. So you've got your outside, which is minimalist. And then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel, which you can incorporate buttons in to. So you still not got a lot of stuff in there. You've maybe got... Like if you're modelling on iPod, you've got five buttons and a wheel. And four buttons are in the wheel. And the other one is a little bit inside the wheel. Yeah. Sure. Okay. So now we've got 30 minutes before our next meeting. In the meantime, the industrial designer over here is going to work on the look and feel design, which I presume will work out what happens. The user interface designer will work on the user interface design. And the marketing expert is going to work on productive evaluation. And as well as that, the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay. And you will get extra instructions from your personal coach. Is that all okay? And anyone who hasn't put their presentation in the project document folder, it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it. Cool. I'm going to go and sell my aim. Oh, nobody wants to talk to me. I know. I'm plugging myself. I'm hating. I've got a bit tangled up in this. So shall I move away first or shall I say here? I don't know. Maybe two. I would care.
