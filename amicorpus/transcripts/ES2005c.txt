 Every time I do something I forget. Right time attached, I'm here. Here? Yeah. Excuse me. We are... The meeting will have the same format as the last time, so same as much switching over up just left and went first to screens day. I have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time. Okay. Cool. And... Is there any questions you have for the right from last meeting? The particular monitoring. No, I don't think so. Okay, cool. Then we shall start with a presentation from that. Yeah. Hi, Miraj again. In this meeting I'm going to discuss about the trend watching. How this trend is going to affect our market potential and how important is this? So we have to look on this. First of all, methodology. The methodology to find out the trend was done in a way. We have done a recent, not only recent remote control market survey, but we also considered the latest fashion trends of the market. Because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit. So what are our findings? In our findings, we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey, we found that people do have preference for the fancy remote controls, which look and feel very good rather than having a functional look and feel good. So this clearly indicates their preference for the design, their outlook of their remote controls. So we should consider this factor as the most important factor. Because this factor is twice as important, the second factor which is further, the twice as important as the third factor. So this factor becomes the most important factor in our mark, means in designing our remote controls. The last one is the most important one. No, the first one is the outlook of the mobile. It should have a fancy outlook, a fancy design. Rather than just having a functional look and feel good, it should have a fancy look and feel good. The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically innovative. We must have some technological advancement in the remote control rather than just putting it as it is as the other remote controls are. So it should be technologically innovative, like glow in the dark or speech recognition, something like that. So that indicates our technological advancement. The third most important aspect to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use. Like it should have too much complicated, there shouldn't be too many buttons on this remote control. It should have too complicated like this way. And customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language, something so that they could know how to use these remote controls. When we did fashion, our recent fashion update shows that I'm not sure if it's a good one. How do I know how to incorporate that? Yeah, we have to, because you can see how people have related their close shoes and furniture, everything with fruits and vegetables. The world is now changing its strength to our organic, becoming more and more organic, becoming a big sponge. Yeah, that's very good. Something like that we should do. People, the feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look hard look. That's good. That's what I was thinking. So that they could play with it while handling it. That should also be taken into consideration. These are my views. The spongy, not real spongy. It could be like rubber when we get it. The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable, that we can take into. It shouldn't be any harm to the environment also, because our company is very, very reputable for taking all these concerns into consideration. So we don't want to have any harm to the society. Okay. That's all. I think I'll find out when I think of that. I remember it from the control. Yeah. Next year, whether any factors that weren't important in the survey, that they said we don't want to find out any such points. Yes, there could be, but we couldn't find out any. So what is it? Function, I think. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You said just. No. You think no. Is that undae? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then F5, right? Okay. Okay. So the interface concept. Yeah. The interface specification. What people, how they interact with it, basically, I think. So the method we looked at existing designs, one of the, what's good about them, what's bad about them. And looked at their flaws. We're going to look at their flaws and everything. And what the survey told us and what we think would be good. So a bit of imagination. The findings. I've got some pictures to show you. Yeah. Okay. So most remote control is these graphical interface where you have got buttons. And you point it rather than having the output as a stream of text or something. And we're also found that there's inconsistent layout which makes it confusing. So I think there are remote control. There is some inconsistency already in existing between remote controls, but I think the standard kind of. Shape and play and those kind of buttons like the top right for on and off. Something I think you find that important because then it's easy to use. And we've got some pictures of some newer remote controls to show you. Do I press escape? F5. And just escape. Escape. Okay. Oh, I see. I'm going to clap for you as well. Yeah. Okay. So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones. I'll just talk you through them. This one is voice recognition. And that's the kind of idea we're going for. There's an LCD thing which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us. This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse which. Yeah. Okay. But I'm not actually sure how you'd use that like. Like scroll. I think the right one. I've got something in front of a monitor. You scroll it and then when you reach the sort of. Manure it and that you require you press. That's like the LCD one. Is it? Okay. But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side. But I presume that the functions must come up on the TV screen. Yeah. I think that's what that is. So these are just a few I did. Again, that's just quite boring shape. Gray looks quite space-adjee but too many buttons I think. And that one. It looks like something else. Yeah. It does look kind of dangerous. This one I thought was really cool. It's got the programability function that we talked about. You can put it in there. It's for your kids and it's quite an organic shape. And the little circle around there is pretty cool. And that's really easy to use. I like this one a lot for our design. I think something like that would be good. Of course, yeah. I mean the one thing I think about it, but these ones is these secured areas. I've seen a lot of them with the cover of the missing. So I can have it heading. Yeah, that's true. So maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the TV or something. And this one, the oversized one. I don't know about you, but I think it's a bit too gimmicky. I don't think that will sell. Or is that not sort of to assist the blinders on things? I guess so. I don't know. I think that's a bit... Fine, don't watch TV. Exactly. Maybe it wasn't too. Yeah. And this one is just pointing out. I like some of these things. The raised symbols and everything, but it's pointing out that this one, the volume, it's kind of pressing down, but it would actually go up because of the shape. So that's a bit confusing. But the buttons on this, I think, is just showing you how you can have different buttons. I don't have to be all the same. So that's quite cool. But people tend to recognize certain shapes to do certain things. Yeah, exactly. So there is some of the findings. So we need to combine those ones. And I've just got an email from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in. Yeah, it is. Just in time, very handy. So I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good. You program it like you say record and then play and then record playing machine and stuff like that. So that's and it's much. Yeah. So that's quite cool. Person preferences, just some imagination. The raised symbols, I feel good. The LCD. It does look smart, but I think maybe for our budget, do you think that would be a bit too expensive? Expensive to have the LCD. Yeah. And the other stuff. And the speech recognition. I think we're definitely going for speech recognition. But in our market survey, we have seen that people are willing to pay more. But they want the quality. They want fancy. Look, they want some new design, something new. Uh-huh. Not budget. Yeah. So even if we increase our course a little bit within some limits. And we give something new, technological advance, as well as new design with fancy outlook. Uh-huh. I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales. Okay. In the market. I'm not sure. Yeah. But for 25 years, it raised 12 euros, 50 manufacturing costs. I think that might. I can't say. Although, I mean, three. Three. Sure. They have got, I mean, they are going crazy with the LCD technology. So that you've got your LCD TV to everything. So maybe the small one. I mean, like, I have the black and white, I guess it just doesn't look funky enough. But, I mean, like, even mobile phones or whatever, I have color LCD screens. Yeah. I mean, I would know about the cost of them. Uh-huh. But I'm sorry. I'm notwithstanding, um, isn't too complicated. Is it going to be too much just overload? Uh-huh. Yeah, that's a thing. It's going to be easy because there will be on LCD screen. There will be different, different icons. They can just click, okay, whatever they want. When you use remote control, you never look at it. Right? Yeah. You're looking at TV. Yeah. That's true. And it just seems kind of like a service. And one of the survey findings was that they wanted easy to use. So I think I'm not sure about the LCD. It's a great, it's a good idea. But for a budget and for the thing we're trying to go for, easy to use, it's not the thing we should go for, I think. Child friend, I thought this was good. As you pointed out there, um, the bit often goes missing, especially with children. But it's a good shape and the organic is kind of, we could make a vegetable-y kind of round shape, I think. So which version? Yeah, I know carrot. So since we're great for the, uh, the company colors, I think your lemon wasn't that... Yeah. And if it doesn't work, you know, it's just a bit of lemon. Yeah. Um, the child friend, yeah, easy to use. It seems quite easy to use. I like the different shapes of the buttons and stuff. I think that's a good idea to go. I like the colorful buttons as well. Yeah. And the mouse one, I thought it was a good idea because people use my, my mouse is now with this scrolling thing. I mean, we are marking the sort of 35 to 35 so most people will have come in contact with us. Yeah. So they'd be able to use that. As I said, I think I'd presume it would come up on the screen. Yeah. So there you go. That means you get to bump that into the TV, it goes. Yeah. So that's the user interface. It's the same. Okay, take this out now then. Okay. So I guess there are a lot of options that we're going to have to choose from among. Yeah. And I'll give you the technical considerations for those. I don't use a whiteboard just because we haven't used it. Yeah. I was just thinking of the self. So the one thing to do this is we're going to take a look at some old and no controls. See how they work. We use the final kind of essential pieces of it. And then we'll throw in our new innovations and keep it all in budget. So, I'm looking inside a very simple and not control. This is what they sent me. Okay, here's the competition I suppose. You open it up, there's a circuit board inside. And there's a chip password, the TA-1835, which receives input from the buttons. This is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip, because it's very cheap and like this is my cost nothing. So that takes the signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it sends to the amplifier, which is made of some transistors and amplifiers, up amps. And then that gets sent to the LED light, which I can see is a red light bulb. And that sends out the infrared light signal to the television. So this is kind of the bare essentials that we need to have in our remote control. So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum amount? No, I mean this is very old ones, so now the new technology is going to be a minimum of small and keep almost a key thing. So this is what we need to have for certain. So as I said, we got the outer casing, the tripped side, you know, it's going to be the board we have to use this, the same setup, processor, we'll probably use a more advanced processor than I had, amplifier and transmitter, or all standard. So for the casing, this email I got from our manufacturing team, you know, we have a bunch of options from wood, titanium, rubber, plastic, but not latex, dull curve. So lots of choices, what do you think? Well, the sponge, I guess, is it on there? I don't know, latex has a kind of spongy feel to it, doesn't it? Yeah, it's very last-a-cheap for sure. Yeah. And that would also give it kind of durability. And it's also relatively cheap to cast. So I'm going to base a sort of plastic, initial plastic with a latex kind of sheath. Okay, so here are a plastic latex. I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think, you know, that could be a bit of a gimmick, like it's good to hold. So something would give to it? Yeah. Okay. And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around. The car is yellow, right? Yeah. Or at least incorporate it. Yellow incorporated, yeah. Okay. I mean, I forgot to... I don't know, other... I think... I think standard silver, kind of, other parts, or... Yeah, the buttons, like, because there's going to be the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons, and probably two different colors. Or if we're having buttons, actually. So yellow, and body, and then what color for the buttons? I quite like the multi-colored buttons, you say? Yeah. You do have ones like playing, could be green or on and off, is red, and stuff like that, yeah? Yeah, or yeah, maybe it's a little bit... It makes it easy to use. Oh, a color so it doesn't look too childish. Yeah, that's true, because that blue one did look quite childish. Although I mean, this also comes to shape as well. I mean, if we are going to make it a novel... I mean, double-curve sounds good to me if we're talking about it, so ergonomic and easy use. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so the shape we want to go... How exactly, maybe... Like an hourglass kind of figure, is that what you're thinking of? Or just like... Yeah, that's sort of comfortable to hold, easy to hold, so you don't drop it. It's not... What about a banana? We could make novelty remote controls. Well, yeah, I mean, like... If we could have a big banana shape remote control, because yellow... Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And a lemon might be a little bit... But then how would you point it? Yeah. How would you point it? It doesn't matter which end point. You could have a little LEDs in the chat. There we go. Yeah, I appreciate this idea, because then this... This will help us in our advertisement also, and we can relate it with fruits and vegetables. The people's choices, that whatever data shows that... Yeah. What do you... I'm sure Red Banana idea. So, it's Fungi. Rubber Banana. I mean... Okay. It does seem like a... Again, childish, maybe. Yeah. I think maybe just draw on the kind of... Fruit and vegetables shape. What else did you say about fashion until it was... Ah, the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables... Like, people... No. And spongy. And then a file... Fruit and vegetable. So it has a stem, perhaps. Maybe. Yeah. It would be some... Like, what's... What's that? I don't even know the name of it. It looks like a little snowman kind of thing. I don't know the name of that. So it looks like this kind of... Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Like a gourd? Yeah, maybe that's a bit... It's black. Because that you can hold it in like bottom bit. And it has a clear top and bottom. Yeah. So you know, it transmits from the sand. Yeah, I don't know why the hell not. I don't know. What do you think? I don't know. What do you think? Well, I guess it's kind of... You don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit. Just have that kind of fruitish shape. Yeah. Yeah. Then only we get a little... Yeah, something... Yeah, exactly. So double curved, single curved... Yeah. Or we can do something we can design two, three shapes and we can have a public survey. Let the public choose what they want. That's a good, learned, that's a good idea. Okay. Okay. I guess, since you're the marketing guy. Yeah, sure. I will be happy to do that. Okay. You can do that. What are the lessons, did we say, different shapes or buttons? I mean, for the specific functions, you know, up and down, placed up. Okay. They've got, I mean, they've got standard sort of intuitive things that are always used. And... It's like that. Yeah. That's cool. I like it. But the scroll wheel or no? Yeah, what about the scroll wheel? Speed track ignition. Speed track ignition, I think. So we need a microphone, presumably. I could put the microphone here. It has a microphone. Yeah. Where should I put it? I mean, are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use? Yeah, I'm not sure. I mean, those ideas I saw were just for inspiration, I think. I do not know. Yeah, I can... Okay, I'm worried. I could... Do some user tests with scroll wheel. Yeah. Yeah. And I think if this new software for the same recognition is that you keep it in the microphone. So should the microphone be just anywhere on it? I would put it sort of sub-centrally, so it's... Yeah. So it can be sort of held in. We're really, really going to need to hold it if it's going to be a voice recognition. Not what we can... Oops. Oops. Oops. So let's not use the whiteboard anymore. Yeah. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. Oops. I'm sorry. And so what else was there? The... What about the glow in the dark thing, the strip around it? Are we just going to need that? I... I still like it. I really like it. But that's me. Because we've got the technological innovation with the speech recognition. Yeah, some of it is just going about too far. I mean, we are pushing it probably... Because it's... It's going to... Yeah. And don't want to... Especially with yellow. I don't know. Because I mean, like... I mean, how good is this speech recognition thing? Do we want to go for buttons at all? Do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit? Do you put it in the fruit bowl? Yeah. You know, and then you just start from... I mean, like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the tail. It could even encourage healthier habits for television watching. Yeah. Make them think of fruit. Yeah. Just make sure they don't eat their amount. I mean... Yeah, do we? I mean, I... Like, think of a fruit that could sit. So then the pen will lay on its own, like, uh... I know, an apple. It's just apples. So... Yeah, the apple's there. I quite like the design of that, because that could sit on its own. And... Yeah. It's quite... It's got a steady bass. Ruby? And as we say, we don't want to be too ridiculous with the fruit things. Yeah, about the speech thing, it doesn't have to be handheld, of course, it can set a distance. Yeah. So, I mean, like, you could actually... Yeah, it's a good choice. Or we can do one thing. We can just have a remote control, and causing some different different shapes, different fruit shapes. In such a way that any causing can be... Could be fit into this mobile general piece. So whatever people want, like, if somebody wants it in a banana shape, we will put that casing onto that mobile phone. It's so light. It will look... Yeah. Yeah. You said about disposable things. Sorry? You said about disposable, Ellie. People want disposable things. Like, if this is a mobile phone, we will design causing in such a way like, half of... We need not to have a full cover. Yeah. We will just have a half of cover, okay? Like, if somebody wants it in banana shape, we will fit banana shape casing onto that. So it will give a banana shape look. If somebody wants it in apple shape, we will design that. We will put apple shape casing on that. It will give apple shape look. So in that way, you can have any... Means whatever you want. Okay. Without... Yeah. You need the buttons in the same place. Yeah, button will be on the upper side. Yes, there's no need. Buttons will be on the upper side. That's the other side. Buttons will be on the upper side. Lower side, we will just put the casing. So half of that will be... No, half of free. Yeah, not the upper side. So from lower, you can... Means while you are holding... From this side, you can have banana look or apple look, whatever. Okay. Okay. We need not to have different, different shape, mobiles, everything. We will just design k-thing through shape. Okay. I think that if you're going to have a fascia, then you want to have it so that it does go for the buttons. Because I mean, if you think about it, if they're wanting it because they want to look at it, if they're using it, and what they want to look at is facing away from them, it doesn't really... Because that'll be in the palm of the hand, we'll be able to see. Yeah. Unless you have serve. You've got the buttons option on one side, you get the fascia on the other side with the microphone, so that you can place it face down. And you've got the fascia, and you can just talk at them. Mm-hmm. Maybe. Okay. Um, so... So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options. Yeah, so... I guess we decide on material, right? It's spongy, latex rubber, everything. And the color is... Yeah. The shape, maybe we'll just make it kind of mix and hatch, type of shape, or... Well, because... Well, I'm not sure if we should go so far on the whole fruit thing, because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit. Okay, we're stuck with what we've got there. Yeah, well, I think we're trying to get to 25, 35-year-olds, want it quite trendy as well, they said, they wanted something that looks fancy, and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a... too much of a gimmick, but something ergonomically shaped and organic, like, good to hold, based on fruits and natural things like that. Okay. Because already we're going a bit... Gordy with the yellow, you know? Mm-hmm. I mean, we could make it a nice pale yellow. Well, it's kind of got a VR company, so... Okay. So, again, I mean, like, we could have... I mean, we could quite easily have the main body be a different... Yeah, maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow, with you said, the Logan, the slogan... And then going round, yeah. Because... I mean, even if... Not necessarily that the whole body has to be of the company colour, so, you know, blue and yellow tend to go to well together, so you have the main body blue with the yellow, local and slogan running up one side of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Sure. Okay. Um, as for the energy source, you know, almost every... You know, probably it's just batteries, but we don't have to be limited by that. We can use a hand dynamo. Um, that's great. I think it's basically the more you move it, the scully thing inside that just kind of powers it. Yeah. Or is it a dynamo? Yeah, a dynamo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like with those watches that you come to us, yeah. So it's quite normal. You see people's natural reaction anyways. Yeah. But, do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo? These type of cells, because then people have to... Like, if this head is out, it's a bit... Yeah. Especially if they want to use it specifically as voice activated. Yeah. Because most of the people... And then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then... Yeah. Okay. That's true. Right. What are the other options? Solar power. Solar power will also not be a good idea, because then they have to keep their mobile's outside. Solar energy and the days when there is no solar sunlight. I'm with Raj on that. I think... Yeah. I've got not facing hands. I think we should rechargeable. Battery will be a good idea. They can recharge it. I mean, I have a bad idea. I have a bad idea. I have a bad idea that I thought just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of... And we're very invariant, different company. Having a rechargeable stand. Yeah. So that not only... Yeah. There was a stand but for using it as... Recharging it, but also for using it. Yeah. So in recognition. Like one of those portable phones. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So a rechargeable battery. Yeah. Okay. The user faced the buttons. I guess we talked about this, right? We were watching chip on print. Sorry. Never mind. Yeah. The electronics. Basically the more features we add. The answer chips we need to buy and put in which adds to the cost. I think we can keep it all on the budget. So the speech thing you said our technology, our research and development department came up with some breakthrough. So, yeah. We're just having buttons on the speech then. We're getting our cheapest option of... Chipping. Right. That's good. Oh, okay. We're kind of... Keep the end of the screen out. We're kind of... I've just deleted that whole thing. We're kind of running out of time. So if you could... And... Was that you? That means you're a bit discovered. Oh, yeah. Just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to see next. Excuse me? Yeah. So... Oh yeah, I'm sure I think. Yeah, mine seems to turn off. I can't do anything. I just touched the pad. You just touched the pad. No. No. You actually showed that. It's on, but there's nothing to do with it. Okay. Now... What... We have... Our next meeting is in half an hour. And what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in Cle. Oh, I guess they do it too. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So, you know, I mean, luckily we chose a nice simple shape. And further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches. Okay. That's great. Save everything to the shared documents. Oh, yeah. I hope I can recover this because of that. So we deleted it. Which doesn't really help you much. I think I'd save mine already. Yeah, can you save that? I send that last one again. Please, Raj. I still can't find it on there. It was under a different name. I will show you. And she heard documents. Okay. Working components. Oh, you didn't get that. No. I will send it. Okay. I will put it in shared documents again. Yeah, project documents. Project documents. Sorry, I put it in the shared documents. All right. That's actually... It goes there automatically if you put in project documents. Project documents is on the desktop. Right. But I can't open that because it... I'll serve for some user name on password. Okay. Yeah. Let me show you. It's a tile mix. All right. I think... Hold on. So... Yeah, I don't know if you... It just came up on my... on my agenda. I'm... I'm... Presumably this clay somewhere. Um... Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Yeah. That's good. Whoops. Light. Light, please. Light. Right, there you go. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Quite. And we're using this sort of basic chipset. So... It's all good. Oh, sorry. Are we done with anything? Um, I think we're almost done. Yeah. You have to give your fans a separate one. I used your pen. Oh, oops. Sorry. Okay. Still didn't manage to get that over. So we have the chargeable and... Uh... Ah, pause. Okay. So we came up with that. Okay. So we came up with that. That's okay. It was supplements. It was supplements. Uh... See? Cool. Fine. I should have gone. See, I knew that. I should have... So... Engineered it so we ended up making it. Yeah. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Engineered it so we ended up making it a different, different difficulty. It's for cruelty. Yeah. Star-free. No, no, no. So we literally make it sort of... ...butchers and everything. No. Should we do it? We have to do buttons. Right. Um, will you go ahead and do this for something? No, I think that's a discussion over and less than. Anybody's got questions? Confusions? No. Excuse me. Um, we'll probably get a question in a minute. It's, uh... Sorry. Thank you. Yeah. I'm going to go warning finish meeting now. I'm running to the upper parking. Uh, did it, did it, did it. I'm going to the upper parking fast. And did it, did it, did it. I'm going to go in. My document says it one more. My private document. There we go. There we go.
