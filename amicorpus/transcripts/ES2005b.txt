 It's from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on rules for each of you. However, there are some changes that I've got from on high that are a bit there. What I didn't actually realize was that this is for a specific television. So they're all in one idea because I don't know. And they require that they... I'll get to that as you see it's point number four. And we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we're going to do from it. So presentations, were you... Anybody got? Yeah. Wearing to go. I need to plug you in. I'm not just a... It's a... inspired design. Do you want me to move? I'm just going to... I'm going to swap the lines. I'm going to... With function f8. f8. Let's see, we blew one of the hearts. Sorry, f8. Should do it. Yeah. Me again, Raj as a marketing expert. As we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out. Someone's fine. If you just go ahead. Actually, sorry. I have to see the other sounds. Sorry. Yeah, thank you. Yes, I have to look at the market potential for this product. And like consumer liking and everything. What is the potential for this product? And are we able to achieve this our net profit or our aim? So, note. Then... Press f5. Sorry. Okay. Yeah, I can... Okay. Then the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey. A detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their liking and disliking. But they prefer, but they note preferable. What problems they do encounter in all these types of things. And what we got first, we found that. Thank you. But they... What problems they are having with the grant remote controls available in the market? 75% of users, they find that the remote controls available in the market are ugly. They are not so good looking. So, we have to put stress on this. We have to take care of this factor also like our design should be appropriate, should be good looking for the consumers. And yes, this will definitely... This can definitely put in house our sales. And even the good thing about this is that 80% of users, they are willing to pay more for this good looking remote controls also. So, even if the available market cost for the available remote control is less, even then we can sell it at 25 euros, which may seem quite high. But if our looks are... If the remote control we design have a better look, better designs, then we can hope that consumers will prefer these remote controls. And the second thing, some companies think that they should have more and more functions of the users in their remote controls. But rather than those having more functions in the remote controls, we should emphasize what actually consumer wants, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated. Because mostly it has been found that 50% of the users, they use only 10% of the buttons. So, there is no fund of having 90% buttons making the remote controls too bulky, too complicated, too expensive. And because I think I believe that technologies use will only if the consumers they want to use it. Otherwise, there is no fund of having all this type of thing. So, this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls, but it will increase our profit also. So, we have to take care of this factor also. It was function I want to go. Oh, you are going to go back just to escape. Then, if we look at this slide, these are your shared documents, you can see. I was just going to say what was the question for us. Are you coming onto that? Look at the market potential. But how we should design our remote controls, what it should be there. So, as to enhance our profit. So, these are different age group persons. Sorry, I cannot open it. Speechwork here. If we look at the cost, whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in their remote control or not, we can find that the up to a 35 year age group, we have a very good disliking for this point like for speech recognition in their remote control. So, we can emphasize on this point also like because it will definitely enhance our sales in this particular age group from 15 to 35. And I think that most of the users of the TV are belong to this age group. We should look at who buys it as well. Yeah, we can look at that factor also. Which other 25 to 35 is usually. If we look at this data, how what are the problems because the owners are facing with the existing remote control in the market? They find that 35% of the consumers they find too difficult to operate in remote control. So, it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide proper manuals, fights use also. So, as that consumers could easily learn and need not to have any much technical knowledge to see to know how to operate these remote control. So, this is also a very major factor to take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales. So, this is all about market potential by me. Yes. Okay, thank you. Following with Helen? Yep, sure. That's cool. Oh, so we do. One of the games. That's it. The cable's going to be longer. I just can't get over whatever runs or underneath. I have this one outside. Okay. Thank you very much. Before it's me to help. Yeah. Okay, and then what do I press F8? F8. Function F8. Alright. Okay, cool. It's not coming out. Function F8, okay. Yeah. Yeah, no signal. Okay. There you go. Computer. Okay. Okay, and then how do I press the big one to get it on to the F5? F5 and I press that again to get it all. F5 and the cable bring it back and just the left button for advancing. Okay, so I'm the interface designer user interface. I'm concerned with what effect the operator should have on the user. And I'm also, I want to point out that our motto put the fashion in electronics. So obviously, as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable. It's a big concern about it. Okay. And how do I press the next button? Just the left there. Okay. Left. So I looked at existing designs and also the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like, what people thought this like. And what people fashionable because we said people between 25 and 35 were the main buyers of our TV, I think. So what they like and what they find fashionable and ergonomics research. I don't know, I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself, but maybe that comes up, I don't know. And the findings, well, that was a basic function, send messages to the television set. That's what people want to do. So they need to be included. But I've got some pictures here of some leading ones. I don't know how to get some. If you're a scape, then you can see your bar. Oh, okay, cool. I've got my glasses. So I hope it fits on. These are two leading remote controls at the moment. You know, they're gray. I mean, this one's got loads of buttons. It's hard to tell from here what they actually do. And they're in, very exciting at all. Personally, I prefer this one just because it looks easier to use. It's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff. But there you go, that's what we're up against. And I think we can do much better than that. I hope so. Hang on. Okay, sorry. Personal preferences. Well, I think we need to, I think the ergonomics is quite important. Particularly, there was a bit in the RSI and things as well. And I thought not too edgy and like a box more kind of handheld more. Not as a computer and organic. Organic, more organic shape, I think. Simple designs. Like the last one we just saw, not too many buttons. And as a Raj pointed out, only 10%, 50% of people only use 10% of the buttons. So I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how nice it is. Hand held and portable, I think, is important. Because TFT have just released, I think, is it a remote control for presentations or in the big screen anyway. So, yeah, anyway, so handheld and portable. And I thought about other functions for TV, but as you pointed out, people don't actually want that. And also the company wants to keep it stuck to the TV for, to keep them stuck to the TV. It's the one TV. Oh, right, okay. Sure. And so the last thing I thought, which I quickly mentioned in the other one, was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people, like blowing the dark. Perfect. Which, it does already exist, but it's not very widely used. I think easy finder with a whistle function or something, or rechargeable station because it's pain when you run out of batteries. And I think that, yeah, that's it. That's cool. So I know it's for talk about speech recognition and whistling. And I just curious now, have we done any research into how many people can whistle? Or is that a function we want in the remote? Do you have trouble with the... I don't, but I know a lot of people do. Really? Yeah, it just... I mean, it has to be a certain kind of whistle TV. Yeah, it's a whistle, it's true. But you could have the... You could have the basically instead of a whistle, if it's got the voice recognition, you could have it just, you know, where are you? Yeah. It's costly though. Much easier thing is just any loud noise, like clapping, shouting, you know. And then, would the response be a beep, a back and you, or something? Yeah, something. Okay. Well, I said this up. So plug it in, press F5. Function F5? Function F8 for the function F8. Yeah. Not that. I need to twit over the thing you've got to think. I think it's just lacking in. It's good. Okay. As the industrial designer, my job is to take an input from you guys. So it's good you went first. And I jotted down some notes as to what are the needs. And we'll kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others. Siraj told us that consumers are going to spend more for fancy products. And you also mentioned that the current products don't always match users operating behavior. A lot of the buttons aren't used. And I mentioned that they're not fun to use. And a novel feature, which you just brought up with this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature. For when you lose your remote, there could be a little microphone on it. And any noise over a certain threshold, it'll pick up as a distress signal from you. And I'll be back and say, no, here I am. Surely that would have to be specific rather than above a threshold. Because if you had a live movie on you, like, they get it. Oh, yeah. You could pick back at you. Well, maybe you could have a, that would be a consideration taking the count. Sorry, didn't mean to do anything. Yeah, well, that's for later down the road. And then as for the user interface, it should be trendy. I'm not computer, so more low tech and not too many buttons. So I took these on to consideration. And also I have some limitations from the boss. And practical limitations, which I kind of threw out the window. And so I did a little research. And unfortunately, all I had to work on was our corporate archives of the great products we've made before, which include spacecraft, coffee makers, and bullet trains. Oh, is that what they are? Or high speed trains. Right. And having personally worked with all these products, I have a great deal of experience with the industrial design. If you can build spacecraft, you'll have no problem with our control. I figured just put them all together. We had a caffeine-powered space shuttle train transport to your TV. And as for the user interface problem, you know, too many buttons. Give it one button. And it's through the cowboy and all of us. I'm not quite sure what the function is there. Well, I like that design. I mean, you could have a... Is that just switches on the speed recognition that it's entirely speech-operated? So I think I missed the budget thing. It was 50 million euros. And we got to solve 25 of them. Yeah. Not a problem. I know. It's 50 million euros. We've got... They've got fixed. We've got fixed. We've got fixed. We've got fixed. So we're making that at 12 and a half. You know what I was saying? Well, I guess more realistically than. We need a product that's got some kind of nifty outer casing, cheap plastic. You know, that should be just like a 10 to the price maybe or less. An energy source, which would probably just be your regular batteries. Okay. Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea? Is that... Or a little bit of a stationery. Yeah. Yeah. We could do that too. Hand-bounded. Yeah. That might cost more there because obviously with batteries, we don't need to provide... Or we provide the first batteries there. Yeah. It's more... It does cheaper. I mean, if you think about these base stations though, it's essentially just a lead with a... So self-connecting brake. So... Right. Okay, I'll press that. The unit is... Okay. The user interface, the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons. But since we're a cutting-edge company, we of course will have alternatives like speech recognition, whistling recognition, and rocket power. Okay. And lastly, the transmission interface is just some engineering thing. You don't have to worry about that. Okay. So here's a great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me. As you can see, the remote control have parts and those parts, like that. And so we've got an operating procedure that looks something like that. And as opposed to you all know how it works because we've all used it. And we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were. Personal preferences, I think, programmable options, which just require a small amount of memory, non-volatile memory, just... So the user can put in their favorite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings that when it turns it on, it's not blasting. That's a good idea, actually. I like the performance of the option. Yeah, you do. And the bells and whistles that we mentioned, you know, take more budgeting, more technical expenditure of effort. And it's also much more likely to not work if we add these bells and essays. Yeah. So all I got. Okay, thank you very much. I'll take that back. Yeah. Right, also. So, you know what I said, got not very long before we think so. Didn't manage to forward onto you is, let's say I'll find it for some. Okay. I think it needs to go in there. Just push. Yeah. We had that to disinclute telltext because it's become outdated. And it's a little bit more complicated than it is. And it's the same. And it's only for this television, which I'm presuming means it's for specific television. Okay. And instead of colors and sort of color options, they want corporate color and slogan, somehow implemented the new design. I presume everything, all this sort of, you know, the corporate website and everything's yellow. And the local, sort of slogan, we put the fashion and electronics. I don't know exactly how to incorporate. I mean, I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape, you could kind of have it working as we're going to. Where am I? Okay. So we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have. Now we had as listed options, we had speech recognition, potentially, flat screen interface, LCD interface. We also want to limit their number of buttons. So we'll pretty much take that one as red. We'll use the basic functions for our television, no teletext. Although the danger with that is it could look a bit cheap. Not enough buttons, you mean the head. So strike a balance between a few. It looks like we're just cutting on the number of buttons. I do, however, have this from over my head. Okay. They don't want teletext on it. Okay, cool. Maybe, Raj, you could find out what people would think about that. I'm going to be the same information about that. What people, other people would require teletext option in their own look. Okay. So I take it your position now, always that. The bells and whistles we've got come up with a gimmick, but not too complicated. Yeah. So I mean, the sort of incline I'm getting from a little bit of web channel I'm getting sent is that are quite interested in a TFT display, interactive display. However, that does say in a bit like the more complicated design that Raj has very Raj said people didn't like you. Although I guess if there's a thing about standard interfaces that people use already, like Windows style, drop down menus, or whatever, I think maybe that's a bit. Going a bit far, but in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons. And if you hit that menu at the top, you have, it goes to a different selection of buttons. So it keeps it simple. Going the dark is that with a light inside it, or is it going the dark material? Glowing the dark material I was thinking. So I guess that would be cheap. I'll see something about this. I think it's really, really very important point, if we look at the market, because people more 50% people they find that the mode controls are often low somewhere in the room. But from last. Yeah, are low. And means they forget where they have kept in mode control last time. But if we add speech recognition as well as glowing the dark, and both these factors will help them locating their mode control. Like if they come and speak something and the mode control replies to something, something, and it glows in the dark. Both these factors, both these points will help them to locate where they have kept this remote control. And this will definitely enhance our market sales. So we should take it into consideration also. Okay. Okay. Well, speech recognition will take it. I don't have no products. There was a much control. There was a much control. It came out two years ago that had some basic speech recognition on it. You could program it with your channels and then say, you know, the BBC one. And it goes to that channel. Yeah, it didn't work very well though, because of this noise and reference problem. And they mentioned, you know, if the television says you are listening to the BBC one. Or an advert for BBC two or BBC one will switch the channel for you, kind of. Right, right. And so there's a lot of this. You'd be watching the TV and then all of a sudden it pick up a noise and turn it off or turn the volume off or something. But if you can work around that noise problem. Well, what about this might get a bit too expensive actually, but what about something that's built into the TV that you can press and it'll send out a little signal. You know, like the ones that we can't hear or something. That will activate the remote control. So like a kind of backwards remote control. Yeah. And then they do just, you know, subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise. What you could do then would be you have a remote control by the TV speaker. I'm sorry, a microphone by the TV speaker and the transmitter there. It sends back to your mode because you can't expect the television manufacturers to put that feature into the device. Yeah, that's the only thing. Yeah, then you have like a little separate module by the computer. It just comes with our remote control. Right. And then the remote control will know what's being produced by the TV. So it'll be basically. Right. And frequency. So it'll be cheap. Right. Right. Yeah, that's certainly possible. And another thing is about this losing their mode and trying to find it again. If you do have this sort of speech interface to it, you don't even need to find it. You just say, you know, whatever you want the remote for, you know, to change a channel. Or to turn the TV on and off. You just shout your command to it and do it for you. If it's within, you know, within hearing range. And you know, it could be somewhere in the room. You have no idea where it is. And it still does jump. That could also be built into the TV. The average might make our room a bit obsolete. Yeah. Well, hopefully we'll do a set of a jaw. A head of the earth. Okay. Okay. I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing. So I think rather than, and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference and not working very well and things like that. And they're expensive. Yeah, and expensive at the time. So I think if we're going to go well, I mean, like to think about the problem with the TFT or the LCD kind of thing is if you're also wanting the kind of organic globbies or feeling to it. Then you might have trouble incorporating screen. But I guess not. I just pretend that's not the problem. And how are you about the blur in the dark and feels? Maybe not even all of it because we said colors and fashion were important. So maybe just like a little line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest. Yeah, the materials cheap, but it's just the, the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it. So if you're sitting in the dark for too long, it won't go long. Or if it's down under the catch cushions. It's pretty easy to find mine. Okay, well, we can use, we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick, essentially. Because what I thought made, if we're going to have to have a logo on as well, bright yellow logo in a slogan. Then, you know, they're going to be fairly bright and colored anyway. And you can have sort of a trimming as well. Just a gimmick. Yeah, more than finding it, that was more like, you know, if you're watching a film in the dark. You can still see the record. All right, so that was more of it. If we're going to go with the idea of feedback, the more finder, then that kind of stuff that one over. You think it makes it fairly unnecessary. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so we've got, we want to go with the TFT idea. Is there a getting quite a few trends now? I think, I think there's sort of finder things. I mean, it's a good pull, but we're right. The circuit diagram, that was out. I think our consideration too is that these remote get abused a lot. And we get thrown around. Is a good chance that the TFT screen would break or get damaged. They're pretty fragile. So is that one of our definite requirements that they needed to do? No, I mean, we were, that was going on rather just sort of marking research, I guess. So stick with sort of programmability for the buttons that we do have. So that's sort of included in your sub module kind of stuff. You're finding out by tell text. Are you good for that? That little speech recognition? I think we're going to scratch this speech recognition as a bit of a, expensive. No, no, it's much cheaper than the TFT. It's just a mic, okay. Some integrated circuits. It'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system. All right, okay. Well, that kind of takes back the RF remote sort of idea as well. I did it. Okay. Decisions. Who wants TFT? No one does. Excellent. So we've got this speech recognition, yeah? Yes. The speech recognition, limited buttons, organic design. And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down enough of falling at my head? Programmability. Glow in dark. Yeah. If it's not a takes sense, I think it's a good game. Okay. And also integrating the member to integrate the logo and the slogan. Okay. So can you put all these reports in the project documents folder? I don't know already in there as well. So it just helps me. Yes. Someerized here. And I'm putting anything I do in there anyway. And where is it, sorry? Project documents on, so it should be when you say my scenario controller on your desktop. So go say that. Oh, is it in shared documents? And then that little folder up there. Project documents. Yeah, it's on your desktop. All the way up. That's the desktop. That's the then project documents. I can't. Hmm. It does not give me anything. Just that, that's it. And I will try to get strings of information. I'll try forward any specific to anybody in particular, as soon as I get them out of them. I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting and then meeting turn up. Did you get my email? I did. Thank you. Okay. What I thought was about the material is maybe not this kind of material, maybe more like this kind of rubbering materials, a bit more bouncy. Like you said, they get tucked around a lot. A bit more durable. And that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all other American controls. The rubber. More surf. Flash like the plastic. Wow. But we have to take care of life. But we have to take care of children also if they, means if children catch out of your life, they should be too harmful. So whatever material we use. Oh no. Yeah. It's funny. We have to safety point of view also. We have to take care. I think with, with the more organic shape that it won't be as good as how many sharp corners is that. I think it's good. I don't know. Where's my girl? She smells good for children. We have to police the other box and make the thing a big red ball, foam ball. So I think they need some. There's no buttons at all. It's always on and just yell at it. That's a good idea. Yeah. So it's going to have to be a big yellow. Oh yellow. Yeah. With the color, does it have to be all yellow? Please God know. Well, I wouldn't, I mean, my reaction to an all yellow or more control wouldn't be anything other than horror. So I think just having it surrounded the logo. It's more yellow strip or yellow square. It's a logo in it. Yeah. Okay. I'll see if I can argue with the boss about putting the, what is it? We put, we put the fashion into, oops, I'm not working. I can't believe I forgot the one. We put the fashion in electronics. Oh yeah, it's a good one though. Yeah. About that I'll catch on around. Okay, Annie, last. Where is Kitty? Top 30. Okay. I know what you're thinking. Okay, that's great. Okay, that felt a bit more like something with the order and the reason to it in the last one. Wow. Does anybody press the K? It's my break. Yeah. Pretty cool. Yeah. Pretty cool. Why are you from the very first page? Yeah. I was just writing like the page. I've got more I think. Yeah, I've been using up pages. I don't want to wait. Yeah. So I finished the meeting then. Oh, every question. Oh, every question. Yeah. Did you do? Did you do?
