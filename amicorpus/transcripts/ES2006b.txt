 Okay, so now we're here at the functional design meeting. Hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time because this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually. The agenda for the meeting, I put it in the shared documents folder, I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not. No, no, no. I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well, so if you check in there, there's a shared project documents folder. And it should be in there. I'm under what, or project documents, yeah. Yeah, okay, yeah. So I'll put it in the area. Is it best if I send you an email maybe to let you know it's there? Yes, yes, thanks. I'll do that next time. I'll act as secretary for this meeting in just take minutes as we go through and then I'll send them to you after the meeting. The main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time, so we'll go through each of you one by one. Then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us. Yeah, the last minute, yeah, the last minute I'm sorry about that, but we can see how that affects what you are doing. And then we need to, by the end of the meeting, come to some kind of decision on who our target group is going to be and what the functions of the MacControl, that's the main goal is to come up with those two things, target group and functions of the MacControl. And we've got 40 minutes to do that in. So I would say target groups, what does that mean? So who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing? Okay. So we need to, yeah, we need to have a fairly defined group that we want to focus on and then look at the functions of the MacControl itself. So with that, I think it's best if I hand over to you. Does anyone have a preference for going first? I can go first. Okay, so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours. Close your streams to give nothing else into the Commons. pp Right. So from the... Just before you start to make it easier, would you three mind emailing me your presentations once we... You don't have to go back. Okay, once you go back. Just so that I don't have to scribble everything down. So with regard to the working design of this remote control, I've identified a few basic components of the remote. And from the design, functional design perspective, we can now know what exactly the components are and how they work together with each other. So this is the method that I'll mostly be following in my... In my row, the identification of the components. And since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects, I would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person. We'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level. And basically update and come up with a new design. So it's a cyclical process. Okay. So these were the basic findings from today. The last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email. I just quickly jotted them down. So basically, as I told you, the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it. And what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other. Okay. So the email said that teletext is now outdated. So we need to do away with that functionality of remote control. Also, the remote control should be used only for television because incorporating other features makes it more complex. And the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television. However, our remote control will only be dealing with the use for television in order to keep things simple. Also, the management wants that our design should be unique. So it should incorporate color and the slogan that our company has it as it's standard. Okay. So here is a functional overview of the remote control. There's basically an energy source at the heart, which feeds into the chip and the user interface. The user interface communicates with the chip. So I'll basically go over to the... Okay. So if this is our energy source, this is a cell. It communicates, it feeds energy into the chip, which basically finds out how to do everything. There is a user interface here. So when the user presses a button, it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal, which then... So the output of the chip is an infrared bitcode, which is then communicated to the remote site, which has an infrared receiver. There can be a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating. So all the functionality of the remote control, whatever new functions that we need to do, make the chip more complicated and bigger. Basically. Okay. So in my personal preferences, I'm hoping that we can keep the design as simple and clear as possible. This would help us to upgrade our technology at a future point of time. And also, if we can incorporate the latest features in our chip design, so that our remote control does not become outdated soon and is compatible with most televisions. That's about it. So anything that you would like to know or... Do you have any idea about costs at this point? No, I don't have any idea about what each component costs. Is that something you need to consider, I guess, if we're using more advanced technology at might? Certainly. So we definitely need to operate within our constraints. But unfortunately, I do not have any data, so I just identified the functional components. Are there any more questions? Or should we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together? I think we need like some general discussion of the end. Yeah, I think that will do. Okay, so do you want to... Yeah, I think since we were discussing some design issues, then I would like to continue to support the whole list. I think that has to come out of here. Thanks. Yeah, I thought those last minute things are going to hit use at worst. Okay, we hope, right? Should it just... Yeah, it'll take some time. It takes a little more. There's just nothing else. And have you... You need to then also press... Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right. And... Erm, F8. So the blue function key at the bottom. Okay. And F8. Okay, something? Yes, coming out. It'll come up with... No signal. No signal. Why? Maybe again. Yeah, yeah, it says something now. Oh, just... My computer won't blank now. Okay. Interesting. I just see. But I don't see anything on my computer now. This is the problem. If you press... If you press function and that again, there's usually three modes. One where it's only here. One where it's only there. One where it's only there. One where it's... Okay, so one more time. Okay, so one more time. And now it's... Okay. No? No. You should... Yeah, just wait for a moment. I just do... Okay. Okay, that's fine. That's good. Okay, let's start from the beginning. So I'm going to speak about technical functions design. Just like some... Some first issues that came up. Okay. So the method... I was adopting at this point. It's not... For the whole... Period of the... Of the project. But it's just at this very moment. And my method was to look at other remote controls. So mostly just by searching on the web. And to see what functionality they used. And then after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web. And just to think about what the user really needs and what the user might desire as additional functionalities. And then just to put the main function or the remote control in words. So the findings were that the main function of the remote control is just sending messages to the television set. So this is quite straightforward. And some of the main functions would be switching guns, switching golf. And the user would like to switch the channel. For example, just changing to the next channel to flip through all of the possible channels. Or then the other possibility would be that she might just want to choose one particular channel. So we would need the numbers. And also the volume is very important. So you could go back. Okay. So switching on off channel. Okay. That's great. Okay. Among the findings, I found that most of the presently available remote controls also include other functionalities in their design like operating a VCR. But they don't seem to be able to deal with DVD players. But then there are surely there are many other functional functions that could possibly be added to them. But according to the last minute update, actually, we do not want to have all these complicated functions added to our design. So my personal preference is would be to keep the whole remote control small, just like the physical size. And then it must be easy to use. So it must follow some conventions. Like where about you find the on off button and maybe the color tends to be red or something. Then yeah, the must have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then the one that allows us to go to the next of the previous channel. And then volume has to be there. But then other functionalities could be just there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen. Then for example, brightness and similar functions could be just done through the menu. And yeah, the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate more functionalities. And the answer was already no because of the last minute update. So for the time being, that's all if you have questions. If that was the directive that came through from management, but if we had a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video on DVD, I could get back to them and see. It's just whether it's worth arguing about. Yeah, and also it's another question is because there are so many different things that could possibly be included. Because besides video and DVD, there are the video CDs and whatever. So yeah, it might be problematic to choose between all these possible things. Okay. Are there any questions for clarification of Marika before we go on to the next one? So in the user interface requirements, we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want. So at this stage, how we go about implementing those buttons, we will not identify or we can completely do away with buttons and have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that. But is there any thoughts on that? Well, I think the buttons are still kind of the most easy for the user to use. What other options would you have a little screen or something, but this would be really kind of a lot of learning for the user. And I mean, the user just wants to get a result quickly, not spend time in giving several orders. I would think the buttons, but if you have other proposals. I think the costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them. We can probably wait until we have more knowledge on that. If the costs allow, we can have an LCD display. Because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well. Sure, we can discuss that maybe after the next one. Do you want to give me a little cable thing? Yeah. Alright, am I going in the right direction? No, wait here. Okay, here I'm getting hungry. Okay, here you are. That's why it wouldn't reach. Okay, cool. Is that? Okay, functional requirements. Yes, we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on our... Hello. I try to pronounce it wrongly. It's working? Yeah. Excellent. What I have, where I've got my automation problem, is a survey. The usability lab I'm served for my control use with 100 subjects. Then they give them a question now. It's all about how people feel about the looking field of the remote control. We'll see most annoying things about remote controls. The possibility of speech recognition in our CD screens in remote control. They actually gave me any answers on the LCD screen so I should have taken that back. Anyway, okay, so what they found is that people don't like how common remote controls are. So, you know, definitely you should be looking at something quite different. 75% of users find remote controls ugly. The other 25% have no fashion sense. 80% of users would spend more to get a nice looking remote control. Current remote controls, they don't match the use of behaviour well as you'll see on the next slide. I don't know what zapping is, but switching between channels, sort of random way going through. Oh, right. But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on. Okay, 50% of users say they only use 10% of the buttons so that's going back to what you know. We were saying earlier about do you need all the buttons on the remote control? It is make it ugly. Okay, cool. So this is one little bit difficult to see. If you explain it to us, it'll be fine. Okay, well I can send it to all of you. Yeah. What it is is it's cones because I thought it'd be more exciting. I like that. Cool. I'm going to start playing with the little punting. Okay, so what it shows is how much things are used relatively. What you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection. What you can't see is volume selection is a little bit higher than all the others. That's the next one along, yeah? So what the graph shows is the power channel selection and volume selection are important. And the rest of them nobody really uses. So the numbers are a lot on the top but present their importance. So on a scale of 1 to 10 how important is that? And you know, channel selection volume selection are absolutely essential and the power while it's not quite so essential apparently. Although I do understand how it can be. And everything else I think you can forget about having those buttons on the American talk. So just not needed and then I used. Okay, this is the bit that the email messed up for me. That's what I was fiddling about with the beginning. Okay, cool. So this is what people find annoying about American roles. They get lost, they're not intuitive and they're bad for repetitive straight injury. I think if you're watching enough TV to get repetitive straight injury from watching TV, that's the least of your problem. It's up there. So I mean the RSI thing would be that like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your rest up, there would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic design that encourages good use of the remote control and not straining your rest watching TV. Yes. Okay, cool. Right, sorry, this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table. I didn't have time to write it out again. Okay, but that shows how people, whether they would pay more for voice recognition software. So you can see from that, you know, younger people, see age of 35 are quite likely to pay quite a lot more, well quite, are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software. Whereas as people get older, they're a bit more skeptical about it and they're less willing to try it. So clearly voice recognition is something to think about. But you know, I do wonder how well that would work given that a TV, you know, tends to be people talking and you know how you're going to stop it from just flipping channels or swatching TV. Okay. Cool. Okay, so these are my personal preferences. So you have sleek, stylish, sophisticated, you know, so something that's, you know, a bit cool, you know, functional. So it's useful, but minimalist. There's an important thing that, you know, people use when, you know, when you're filling up your home, you know, a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap, basically, you know, and you've got this stuff and you're just like, what the hell is that? Who is ever going to use it? You know, so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both. So I think we need to aim for both. Okay, then long back to life, like you were talking about earlier. And you know, I was thinking solar power would be quite cool because, you know, your remote control just sits there and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit. And then like a locator, so, you know, kind of like you have a mobile phone or not a mobile phone. Some kind of a ring. Yeah, that's it, you know, whistle and it's where my flatmate and I were talking about this on the way and he knew this morning and I was like, I need to get one for everything. So yeah, so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps and then it kind of sound that you don't often hear on the TV. You know, because you don't want to remote control beeping every five minutes. Because you then deliberately lose it by throwing out the windows and things and say, okay, cool. That's me. That's you. Excellent. Very good. Very good. I'm just going to take this. So we've got about 10, 15 minutes to discuss. I think one of the very interesting things that came up in Cape Cat Cat's presentation was this issue of like voice recognition being more popular with younger people. So if you need to have a target group, then I think as far as the motto of our company is concerned if you want to have things leak and good looking, we are better off targeting a younger audience than you know, people who are comparatively elderly. Yeah, I mean, that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey, you know, whether, you know, these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish microphone, but I'm assuming you know, yes. But the survey did say that things like voice recognition are more popular with them. So if you want to put in something stylish then it will certainly be more popular with the younger people as compared to older people. Yeah. Then again, I guess the where it was most popular was the 15 to 25 bracket. Right. And I don't know how often they are buying television. Well, that's when you go to uni, isn't it? But you don't have much money generally. I would assure a television or something. It's more that 25 to 35 when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys. Yeah. But still, if you can go back to that slide and how popular are they? I'm sorry, I'm not getting it. That's already if you can just look it up on your computer. Yeah. People between 25 to 35, how popular are ones? 76. Still quite popular amongst them. Even they are 76% of the higher. Yeah, and I mean I know what you're saying about the 15 to 25 yards but I mean it has been proven that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like, I mean, you know, if you invest in them, you're paying your rent but you don't have a mortgage, you don't have a life insurance policy. Usually not like hard and normally have a car. You still need to buy that. I've actually said that, it's just cost more than a car. Yeah. Say, I mean, like it is an age group to target really. And if we're talking 25 euros is a price that's not unaffordable even for you. No, I mean that's like 15 pounds. Yeah. Yeah, this is not unaffordable but the problem is whether people need it, whether they do have a TV. Yeah. I don't know many people without a TV. We didn't have a TV last year and everyone thought we were for heads. But the TVs are often kind of someone's old TV. Yeah. And the remote control might not be remote. It might not even function with a TV. Yeah. Well, we've... But even in the case of 25 to 35, it's quite popular, right? Yeah. Or maybe we can just kind of... I think the fact that 91.2% of 15 to 25 years old is saying, yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition. Yeah. When I control this, I say quite a lot really. So, I mean, that and the display is like bullying, and I don't think it's something to ignore. And the same time, I think, maybe we can just decide to have both of these groups as our target. Because, actually, I mean, they are all still good. It's not much different. Yeah. If we take 15 to 35, but that does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition. Is that going to have an implication? I was having a general outlook on most sophisticated features. But voice recognition itself, I'm not very sure about it because one of the things that Kurt pointed out was, how do we go about implementing it? You do have it in your mobile phone, they don't need it because you have, I mean, every mobile phone now has, like, call this person. And it calls it. Well, how frequently do we use it anyway? Yeah. How good is it, you know, voice recognition software that's still quite... But with a TV remote, it's going to be quite limited if we're saying the main things people want to do is on off Channel 5. Yeah. Right. So, that should be relatively simple. You would maybe need a code word. Do you know what I mean? Right. So, like, when you say, change, it's been said quite a lot on TV, so maybe, like, you know, remote. I mean, how often do people say remote on TV? Although I only watch Chan, so really, I'm friendly. But, like, say, just say, remote 5, you know, remote 10, remote 19. Okay. So, it seems like a feasible thing to implement. Yeah, but maybe if you want to look into that just to check. So, if we go for the 15 to 35-age group... Yeah, but then, of course, we're going to get anyone who's older than 35 who wants to look young and hip and trendy and have money. Then, now, they'll still go for the same advertising. I think there's a lot of voice recognition. Well, now, the voice recognition, if it works wonderfully, we could possibly do well with all buttons, but I think this is not really the right moment yet, because people are just so used to buttons. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of... I think we need safer. So, we need both. So, the voice recognition would be just an extra. It wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote. What I was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on TV and how they are numbered on the remote control. If we can do away with that, our product can be really popular in the sense that a person can say, I want to watch ITV1 instead of saying that I want to go on channel number 45. Yeah. So, if something like that can be in cloud 3. So, that is that was in the voice recognition. Yeah, but then the code word would be even more important, because I mean sky advertising every channel to me. So, then it would be watching charm. And then the sky adverb, come on, and it would change to sky. Sky. Yeah. Yeah. And that would be really annoying. Right. But that's it. Yeah, but on the other hand, the remote control is close to you. You probably might just speak into it. And the TV would be already farther away, so it might not pick up the things coming from there. You know, I think that defeats the objects of having voice recognition on the remote control. So, that you can yell at it. Yeah, you know, so you have to have the remote control. It's more like if you lost it and it's down the surface and you can yell at it. Or just change it, you can look for it later. Yeah. All right. Yeah, but then the remote control, I think, I mean, the idea is kind of, it's not that it's sitting there on top of the television, because then you could already yell at the television, and you wouldn't need the remote control. So, the remote control is still something you keep near yourself. Yeah. I suppose, never too. Yeah, I think it's like if you have some sound. And it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise. Yeah. So, the remote control being close to us, not to yell at it from the distance. Another thing that can be used is that there can be a beeper button on the TV, so you can go and press that button and the remote control wherever it is. It will beep. But then if you're buying the remote separately, but you could have something. But if it was something that you could like stick onto the TV or something. Right. Yeah. If you bought it in a two-part pack, so one part attached to the TV. Yeah. And then you didn't lose it. They're being located. Well, that's right. But it solves the problem of having different noises. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Okay. I think we're going to have to wrap this up. But if we go away with that kind of general specification in mind that we're looking at 15 to 35-year-olds, we want it to look simple, but still have the button. And then we want it to look simple, but it's easy to use. But only those key buttons. The major buttons. Yeah. And then one sort of menu one. And then voice recognition included as an option. Right. But that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible. And some of those problems we were mentioning. What we have to do now is to go back to our little places, complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation, which you'll get immediately by email. Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes. And then we've got a lunch break. And after lunch, we go back to our own little stations and have 30 minutes more work. I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder, but I'll send you an email when I do it. So you know, should be on your desktop. So on the... Okay. Yeah. So I'll put them there as soon as I've written that. Did you find it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And email them round. I'll see. You want our PowerPoint presentations in there, he? Yeah, that would be great. So we'll just put them there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But is everyone's called functional requirements? No. No, they're all called something slightly different, technical requirements, something that's good. So if you put them in there, we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to. Okay. As to where we're going from here, you're going to look at the components concept. Right. Yeah. Whatever that means. Yeah. Yeah. You'll be looking at the user interface. Conceptual. Yeah. Something conceptual. And you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition or the math or something that will keep our... I was supposed to look into components. Components. Sorry, but the next meeting, are we going to have it right after lunch or shall we prepare? We have after lunch, we have 30 minutes to prepare. Yeah, that's fine. But before lunch, we just have to complete the questionnaire in some sort of summary. Okay. Okay. For right on time. Okay. So you can, I guess, we'll see you for lunch. Okay. See you.
