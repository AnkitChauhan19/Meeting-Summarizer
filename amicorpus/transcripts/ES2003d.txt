 that should hopefully do her trick. Sorry about this small delay, but I got a little bit behind schedule. Okay, so just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one, we're going to go for something, how was it, the new black of a leaf? Something that looks good because that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end, but we should never avoid functionality, of course. Many of our components are going to be standard off the shelf, but it seemed like we were going to require at least an advanced chip, and we were stored very much for the idea of using an LCD display. Other things where we were hoping to use rubber, most likely going to be double curve, etc. Okay, so due to your hard work, we might as well let the two designers go first and show us the prototype. Okay, that's a quite hard way to do this, I'm not sure, but... I think we will step up and do it. Doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design. For one thing, it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for hand-inness is down here for the LED as it turned out. The whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick, so it might be an idea to be able to adjust the position of the base of the joystick just a little bit. Just a thought, you could simply have a slightly over-hoid shaped joystick, they could then just be twisted around so that the stickier is, so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other. But as you see with the holding it in the left hand, the LCD is nowhere useful. So that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain our ergonomic design. Now, I got your note about keeping the cost down. We'll go into that a bit more, but this design could be done with plastic casing, though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle, having the edge to rubber grip over that, which will allow for a slightly water biomorphic form and a bit more ergonomic as well. As for the single curve, this edge and this edge, like I said, would be nice to have some curvature to it, but it's not absolutely necessary. Really, the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the joystick rests over the edge of the hand like this. There you have the cosmetter here. No, we speak here for the remote control finder. Any further comment? Obviously it's going to be bulkier than it looks because it's going to be flattened on side. So that LCD will stick in there, I guess, because it can't get accurbed. I mean, that's cosmetter and it's plastic as well, so it'll be as cold as full on the hand. I mean, with the rubber design, it could give pretty much mold very much to the user's hand. One nice feature if we could still do the rubber. I thought it was to have the rubber extend beyond the end of the bridge of substructure. So it has a recent tail, you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely. Yeah, that's it. Okay, yeah, great. Yeah, I've got a few load up my, by the way, so yeah, okay, yeah, like I'm actually going to work. Are you values? Basically, we need to rate the prototype by. Then we will, it's a 7-step kind of evaluation process. So, not 7-step, 7-scale. So, after we finished doing all the ratings for each criteria, we averaged that. And that would give us some type of confidence in our prototype. And the criteria are based on real reactions, kind of goals, policy, marketing strategies. And also those are put together from the user requirements page. If you put the... So, those are the criteria. Perhaps I could have put them a bit better, but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned, which means that the product was scored very badly on some of those points. But it might be. So, we have them. True. 1... 7...8... Okay, so we have to go through each point. We imagine that's actually straight. And just give it a score. So, how well would you say the prototype is... How well we realise the dream of being able to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they're lost? I mean, is the homing thing still the locator? Yeah, that's still part of the design. Sure, and Adam, we can keep that in. Yeah, I believe so. So, I mean, I don't think anybody could actually stop remotes being lost, because that would mean doing something about human. Yeah, sure. But, I'd like to think that we've done something about finding damn thing once we have. Sure. And making it a bright colour helps them. But personally, I've gone for purple, no. Bright colour, so we still have that noise-bingen. On a score of 1 to 7, how would you guys rate it for finding it once it's lost? I'd say number 1. Number 1? Okay. Number 1 for the first grade to you. I think if it was just the sounder, then there's something I found with, we're saying, trying to find the Carlos Fona mobile, you can hear it, you can't quite pin it down where it is. Yeah, you can tell what the mobile is. What about the volume on TV's turned up massively? And here's one I turned down, the volume can't find the remote. Suppose you have to go to TV and... Yeah. Yeah. You wouldn't hear it at the speaker. Just before we go through all of the steps, you want to say something here. Well, what we'll do is, if we can look at the Craycure, you've been able to evaluate, and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's all right. That's fine. Yeah, that's up. That's fine. So, is there anything here that you want to do covers and the criteria that you've covered, and then we'll come back pretty much properly to this. What does it mean? Is there anything on it? Is there any of these criteria that you need any explaining or is there anything that you thought really would stand out compared to the others? A few. Some of you got neglected for my initial research is that raw reactions has a goal, strategy, that all of their products being inspired by interior fashion and clothing fashion. That is why food and veg being popular in their home and clothing was important. And they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends and fashion. So, they say we put the fashion electronics where they really mean it. They're very big on fashion. So, that's this bit right here. And this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody. I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use into this. So, we're kind of condensed into one. And we can come back to it. You said, it's okay. No, and we will do very, very shortly. Okay. Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. Most of it stems from the use of the LCD, which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure, because of course we were required to chip as well. The only way to get this down was either to ditch the LCD, at which point we've removed a large part of how we were going to interface, we would require more buttons, etc. Or what we did was that we, as an I, as quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. Changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curved design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs. And we're just scraping it in. We've got point two for you to left over there. So, we're just managing it really. Even then as well. There was no criteria technically defined for a joystick, so I've used what I think is appropriate with any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to. It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side. For example, the possibility of having the USB connection is definitely not all valuable now. Different languages. That should still be viable. We've got an advanced chip. We've got the use of the LCD. So, being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility. But, what's something we need to decide on is how we're going to go from here. We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people, if need be. We can bring the excel sheet up and show you if you wish. I really think as much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design, possibly meaning that the LCD wouldn't be in this perfect place. It might be slightly between what would be good for left-handed and what would be good for right-handed person. I suppose one thing that could be done is how it's circular and how it's so that the pink... Actually, it goes a bit over the pinky finger. It very much is about making concessions, unfortunately. Do you have any data on how much different prints cost? Can you get the entire thing printed with a design? But is you mean on the plastic? I have as much information as I do. As you can see here, for example, the battery, really not very little choice in that one. We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well. Unfortunately, we require the advanced chip if we're going to do what we're needing to. I said single curved. We really do need it to be that way, and for the ergonomics of it. Plastic for some reason, in Curves No Costs, which I've had to very much make advantage of, despite the fact that Robbers only got a value of 2 euros per unit. Problem comes here, as you can see in the interface. If I've read this incorrectly, then we can say 0.5 of a euro here, and it's not per push button. That might make sense because then a numeric keypad would come in at 4.5 euros, which is an awful lot, so that could well be wrong. Even if we say 0.5 there, it would just mean it would most likely place it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit, which is up to be put to some side. As you can see, the use of an LC display, advanced chip, and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well, because it's an integrated scroll wheel push button. Wasn't quite what I think had minor joystick. Why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together? That's quite significantly expensive. I... that's something you have to take up with the bean counters. As you can see, that's taken up well over half of the price. So, very much open to suggestions of where we go, but because we need to shed what was for use off of the price of what we really desired. This one comes in under price, as you can see, but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design. We don't even have speakers here. Like we... what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that? I really like to that. No, we haven't. Transreader receiver speakers plus the extra device itself that's going to be on a TV, is that going to be a button or... It literally would just be a button. We might have to... It looks like almost nothing... No, good call, I missed that. I mean, it's not on here, but... No, it's a very valid point. Did they... do we have to use an advanced chip for the LCD? Yeah. Okay, I guess. So, if we're going to go with the LCD display, then that's... Was that hand down at dynamo? You have to wind it up? It's really so here. That would probably not be in keeping with the... Fashion statement, such, yeah. The basic of the only new thing is the LCD on the remote. The manipulated by the joystick here. Ah, I'm just... Which I'm defining as scroll wheel. And we can't replace the joystick quite because we would need for what your buttons do. Place it up down left and right, and that would be more expensive than it. But is the scroll wheel not just back and forth? Yeah, it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be that... That's what I've labeled it for, purposes of this evaluation. The LCD is the big, selling point of it. If we remove the LCD display, we could save ourselves a fair amount. Which you can't sort of make it original, but... Yeah. I think if we remove the LCD display, then there would absolutely no point to any of these meetings. We could just put our branding on any other remote control. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It's a shame we should possibly... If we could have increased the price, we could have manufactured that, and then we could have got some people by closer to what we were. Does this open here? Does this bear in mind that... I mean, it's a bit ridiculous that they're going to charge us. Was it like this much money for three million if we're going to buy a three million components? You know. You'll have to argue with the accountants on that one. But for the purposes of this meeting, we're going to have to stick with these figures. So, I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're going to keep the LCD display. It's about what really separates us from the cost it's going to incur. Are people maybe not happy with what are willing to go ahead with this and going for a plastic solid case to keep the LCD? I want to think how much extra would it be to keep the articulation? It's hard to tell. I would say that you're at least going to take double-curve, but even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation. I think that it wouldn't require it to be double-curve. Yeah, it could still be similar curve. It's just that the case would come into it. Would be made in two parts and then trying to get it with an articulation. Could we not get rid of the curve? The curve is the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface. Could we have restrictions on? That's what we need for the joystick. I mean if you look closer at the prototype here, the lines here along grip are actually quite straight. But the curve is all over the hand. Yeah, on the LCD, although we've done it with the curve, it could just easily be done without curves. The curve that's really needed is up here to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position in fact to have it rest on the top of the hand. Okay, my bad. We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway. I mean, for the purposes of this meeting, maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation. Unless we hear otherwise, we could go ahead with that proposal. The product is not going to perform so well for my criteria. Which is what we can get onto now. As long as we're going to say, we'll have to keep an eye on the time as well, but we're going to say... Oh wait a minute. The single curve design. Sample speaker. What is the sample speaker? Is that somewhat similar to what we want? It could well be there. Of course. Of course. Of course. Of course. Of course. We've got the email about, I thought it was just completely pointless. You got an email about voice response? Yeah. I did not. All right. Basically, there's a signature labs that come up with a chip that you could say hello to and it would say hello back to your friends and family. Okay. We'll definitely go with that one. We won't go with that one, is it? I mean, that's voice recognition. Okay. Okay. So, okay. Battery definitely. So, it looks like we're going to get rid of the whole locator thing. It looks like it. Unless we can manage to put it in under point two euros. Okay. Maybe you know, you've pretty much point two euros, it's it. So, we'll leave that one for now. We'll go for a special color dot. It's a case of, I'm slightly unsure. 1.5 of a euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right. So, maybe it's a case of push button is maybe one or more. In which point for a case? Oh, do you already incorporate that? Oh, especially for the case. Well, you've got point five there. It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct. I'm not quite sure if there, I don't think you mean point five euros per button. Okay. Well, let's say that and then we can have our special colored case and then we at least have, make it a little harder to lose. There we go. Because most, most of the modes are a fairly dingy color that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap. What's the default color, the white or black? Black probably the normal color you'd see. Oh, great. I quite like that color with your effect. It's definitely make it glow in the dark even better. So, we'll go with that then. Okay. It's not, and we can see you will come back to your evaluation in which you're probably now going to pan us. Okay. Okay. So, just to give you an idea, you'll want to go maybe a bit quickly as well. I'm not sure how much time we've not hit the five minute mark. Right. We're working yet, but. Okay. Okay. Ability to start remote from Mingloss or to find them once they're lost. Okay. Special color. Special color. Four. Four. Three. Three for being generous. I think we can do three. Three. We're being generous here with three. The special color doesn't, what I think make a difference. It makes it stand out from, you know, it's lost in a big pile of crap. It stands out from the rest of the crap. Okay. We used to number of unused buttons. We're down to two buttons, is it? Two buttons. No joystick. Okay, so that's the one. You know, we're, that's the, yeah. Actually, we're going to do that. We're going to do that. We're going to do that. We're going to do that. We're going to do that. We're going to do that. Okay. That's the, yeah. Actually, we're doing well there. Okay, that was good. Easy to use interface. The buttons menu, menu is cool. That's, yeah, that's good. Okay, that's, we're not doing so badly. Easy to use. Oh, okay. That's forget that one. Fancy looking. It doesn't get much. Sure. We could do whatever we like with the LCD. Yeah, that's just assuming it's a good LCD display. Maybe I was panicking for no reason. I've got one on the fan. I'd say we go to because like the fanciest would be it'll occur. Yeah, maybe a bit. Yeah, with the articulators. There we go. Yeah, that's better to more accurate numbers, no logically innovative. Well, we're getting rid of the locator thing, which is a shame, which, yeah. I believe for this for that. Free. Yeah. And the menus thing is something you don't know. We see on, um, on a remote. You see it in a lot of other places. Yeah, mobile phones. And what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control. So it's, you say free. I might go as far as two in there. Free. I'm giving it to you. Three. Free. Okay. Okay. Okay. And the next one anyway. So some people find pleasing. This is what they really would have wanted. It is. Yeah. Don't blame them. Um, because of the way that we've minimalized the number of buttons and such. Plastic. It sucks. But it's no worse than any of the other remote controls they have. That's true. It's not a step backwards. Yeah. Five. I give it six. Yeah. Okay. Let's give it six. Okay. That's totally from everything. Go for balance. And spy by the ladies, interior and clothing fashion. We could. What color will we get to make it? Lepor print. I would say give us a give us a selection of colors. Um, yeah, we'll be yellow for the prototype because we had yellow. If I were buying one, I'd go for perfect. Lepor print. Well, um, by this, I think it's more okay. So. Yeah. The color of the border there. It's fine. That's. Don't stand there. That yellow. Yeah. It would also help keep the product placement. Logo. Yeah. Well, it inspired by including clothing fashion. They're referring to the fruit and veg. Think. Is this like a banana type color? Could we stretch? No, there's no shape like a banana. It's a kind of. It won't be for just being. Oh, because it's flat. Objected. What is this? Fruit? It's just flat. I think. I think this is not particularly fruit and veg. Yeah. We might have to suffer badly because of one as well. Well, it's probably more fruit and veg in most of the things that are, yeah, bar fruit and veg. So. Four. Four. All right. That's very ambitious. I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criteria. I don't think it's the sole criteria for being inspired by this. Fashionable and inspired by current passions. I can't wait. I'm sorry. I didn't even know. Let's disfigure against this is their motto. Yeah. I'm not doing well. This is a strategy. Imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is going to be proportional to the marks. We might want to be a bit more skeptical about this one. What would you think yourself? I would say, I mean, it's not at all. In any way of shape or form. Well, it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow. That's pretty much banana like. Okay. Yellow banana light fingers. I think it's okay. It's got a curve to it. So, 5 is that so unreadable? Yeah, I got stretching the use of a banana. Yeah. Okay. So, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So, 5, 7, 10, 16, and 21. This gives us an average of 3. Well, this would be in the middle. So, it's not bad. It's only good section. It's not bad and considering the... Don't pick the pen. Oops. Sorry. I'm sorry. What do you not like? I'm not going to say it's bad design. Considering the price we had to get this in. To have a positive, you know, even based on the four of us being heavily biased. Yeah. It was going to be quite hard to get anything standing out, I could say, possibly, based on the cost features. So, even if we were to increase this entire thing by 7, we were to go down a grade to 4. We would have to do... I mean, we weren't that kind of optimistic, too overly optimistic. We didn't add... We didn't subtract our whole 7 points from the user thing. So, I think we're definitely on a good bit. Even if we gave this one 7, this one 7. That's still only 3H to points over 7. Yeah, we did... It was okay. It was good. Personally, I think given the product only replaces a single remote control that you've already got. Are people really going to show out 25 euros for something that's only marginally good? Well, it depends here what the target people are, like you'd say. Maybe fashion conscious women. Maybe women. We don't know. Look at that. It's cool. It looks like a banana. It's cool. It's got a look good in the sit and room. I think rather than the LCD. Whereas, more technical, like more people in the device technology, like it's good. It's going to LCD screens. Only got two buttons and a joy six. So, which kind of people would be more likely to buy? Probably the people technologically. They usually want to buy point and stuff. I think so. I mean, my mom still has not learned how to use text messaging on her phone and she's had it for a long time. You know, she uses it to make phone calls and that's it. That's it, mom. Yeah. So, I think if my mom saw remote control like this, we're only two buttons and a joystick. I mean, I'll probably be the first one to decide not to buy it. She would like, is this a remote control? I don't have to use it and stuff like that. Even if it is really user friendly to us, but where you see using menus all the time. I thought that's one of the things that because it's technically innovative, for someone who's sort of technophobic and fri- that simply looks unfamiliar or be daunting. Yeah. I think it's totally radical to have remote control, no number buttons. But like radical, good. I don't know how long we've got at least five minutes, I think. We will pop on to project evaluation. So, we've got these four criteria here for satisfaction. Does anybody want to have any opinions on any of them? For example, forward backwards, I suppose, the ability to work in this project using the technology we've been presented with. If people made good use of the pen and paper, I would say I have no noodles. I wrote Mary A. Page, but not. I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be. I think it's a really good thing that digital pens, most of it, they're the sectors that we use. It goes into their office. It would have been nice to be able to transfer our paper notes onto the computer or something. Yeah, that would have been pretty good. It does seem like a paper, still a heavy consideration for taking notes. So maybe this is literally just the way around it. I know how are people satisfied with the teamwork with managed to display today? I like it. Leadership. It's a great deal. Last one we've got is room for creativity. Until accounts came along. We're not lacking in ideas. Yeah, I think of in the end ideas that can be used and sadly is meaning not so much that we weren't full of ideas, but of ones that are going to allow us to actually build the thing. It's a bit of a pity. I would have to agree in that. I think we needed a larger budget. If you're going to aim your product maybe at technological sector, then you can afford to maybe check the price up slightly from what it is. Because they will pay what they just cash at the people. I think for retaining the more of a biomarker form and the articulation would gain more profit and sales than it would lose in added expense. The price was twice the assembly cost. Would it have to be twice that? It could have had the assembly cost. It could have had the cost of maybe 50 or so. It could still have set up for 25. That's true. I think the tools we use all have to be taken up with a different group I guess as to who the cost involved. But we've got a prototype. I think it's gone okay today considering the information that we have. Maybe the accounts would have been better if we had a list from a... Yeah, to begin with. Probably would have come up with a lot more solid design in the end. I would have to agree. It is very much a pity to get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too extensive. Always hard to tell until you know the costs. Okay. I had a cost with him budget. There are now that we have a slightly less than capable product. We evaluated it and we can see that we came out with a value of 3. One thing I would say, I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product. The product testing and market research process would be to produce more cups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over budget would make to sales. Which, yeah, unlike response from consumers, we could even market two versions. We keep the version to be nice, I love it, I love it. And then the final one where you get to call it how. But we'll go into that later. Right. Is there anything else that anybody would like to add? No. Anything that's not being covered before I quickly write up the final report. I don't know, I mean we've got a product. We maybe aren't as happy with it as we like to be. But we've got something we think we can maybe stick on to the market and sell. And of course something we have been avoiding talking about because we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers. There's a huge market. I mean we briefly touched in a move, no more knowledge than there's little we can say in that. Yeah. So, um, let's say nobody's got anything they'd like to add. We can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we need to and then we can finish up the writing and such. Yeah. Okay. Thank you for your participation. Thank you. Wait a minute. I was actually kind of upset, you know, at the budget and that we had to cut a lot of stuff. But man, we can't have the location thing. That's fast. If there maybe were the prices were made. That's a question you can ask in a while. Okay.
