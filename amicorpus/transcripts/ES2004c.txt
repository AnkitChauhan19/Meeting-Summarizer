 I'll wait until you're all in. I'll wait until you're all in. Welcome back everybody. I hope you had fun. Right. This is our conceptual design meeting. I'm going to give you a quick look at the design meeting. I'm going to give you a quick look at the design meeting. Welcome back everybody. I hope you had fun. Right. This is our conceptual design meeting. I think we're starting to head over ourselves from the last meeting. Yeah. I was getting the impression as well. I think yeah. This is where we talk about Provide to use materials, user interface, and trends, and trends. I think we've touched on a few things to be left already but we'll just go over it. The minutes from last time we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext. It wasn't going to be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it. We have decided on leaving out the voice recognition. We've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal. We were thinking a shell but something along the sides just different shape from what's normal. You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries. Yep. We were going to think about the port and alarm for getting it off. Things like that. Our market was going to be young business kind of range. Okay, so she was starting with the first presentation. Yes, I hate the...just connect up. Thank you. Okay, so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend-watching. The methods we used to decide on current trends and so on, market trends, were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with our 100 subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most important aspect we had in our remote control device and we'll come to that later. So that was one of the first things we did. Also with our company being four owners in putting fashion into technology, we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. So the general findings from that was in the market trends, the most important aspect from the market trends. So the general findings from that was that in the market trends, the most important aspects for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel, rather than the current functional looking feel of remote controls. They also want a remote control to be technologically innovative and of course as we predicted that it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings, fancy look and feel is the most important, as twice as important as the second technologically innovative, which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. So possibly the feature that we put first is actually third. It's still important, but it's third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at. Okay. Now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group, we found from our consultants in Paris and Milan who attended all the designing fashion fears then, but fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes, shoes and furniture. So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too? There also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials again in contrast to last year. So a lot of interesting feedback, they're both from our market research department and from our people in Paris and Milan. We're interesting to see what our design people make of that. So we're very much let's start from inside and work our way out. Yep, okay. Unless anyone has any questions about that? Not yet. Okay. Yes. Thank you. I hope this got a finish. Yeah. I say if you do the one too tight and you can't get the new furniture on there. I know. Okay. This is all about the design of the edge components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. Okay. First, the... into the method, the main idea of the whole thing is just so you... you just press buttons and it should activate things on the TV and we discussed last meeting it should be easy to find. Also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials because some of the things that we looked at last time unfortunately aren't available. Findings. I've got my nice little picture there. This is the chip called the TA-W1-A35 which is what's used in pretty much every remote control because it sends out standard signals based on your input. It's pretty much used for all TV remotes at the moment. And then we're looking into battery options. There's actually no rechargeable option available. So I saw the standard AA and triple AA which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment. Dynamo charging. I thought that might be a bit silly to be honest. It's basically like wind up radio. So you wind up your remote control before you use it. How long can you get out of that? Can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night? Yeah, I presume you wouldn't have to wind it for very long but I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you think of the next two options like the solar charging. Most people have the light on in the room anyway. So they could get when you got to do it. Is it? I'll write it. Regarding the sizes, which one you think will be like because we have to take into consideration size also. So maybe standard triple AA might take less space or might take more space? Yeah, it would. The dynamo would take more space because you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up. I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun. Yeah, okay. I don't think it can. But I mean, that's not many. You don't want to limit your market. I mean, people who live in basements like there's not that many people. I know, different products are people too. If we're at the marketing internationally. Yeah, most people, most people also watch TV in the night. Yeah, but then it would be charging to the day. I think the point is they charge us through the day. And then you've got it charged. But I think the next one's the best anyway. The kinetic charging, which is like you get it in wristwatches. Yeah, and you don't even notice it. I mean, the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge it up. I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work. And are this like a, what is the life of the kinetic battery? It's like it runs for a long time. Yeah, it charges into some form of, it's a smaller cell, which it charges into. And the size of a watch battery, because they use them quite frequently and watch it. And that would last for, well, I don't, I'm not entirely sure how long it would last, but I've never seen one run out. But then if you think about watch, it's on your wrist, but it's on your whole body, it's on your body the whole time. So you're walking around you doing things. It is moving a lot of the time. Yeah, and you switch the TV on, then you put it on the side, then you pick it up to change it, then you put it on the side. Yeah, but then again, I think it is, because if you think about it, watch, although it's only a tiny amount, it's always moving for the whole day. And they don't run out overnight when you leave them on the side. Okay. And for the same reason, you're only using it for an incredibly short amount of time, just to send the signal, and then you're finished with it. You put it on it. No, no, I don't think the drone will see. Referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with standard batteries? I mean, could people put standard batteries in, but they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging? Or the two things not compatible? Yeah, I think you could have a dual power thing, but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case. And they, because if you, like, on a calculator, they're quite big and they all look identical. They're very expensive. They're expensive, they don't... I presume that normal batteries were the cheapest. Yeah, the normal batteries would be the cheapest. I presume that then it would actually be the solar charging ones, but the... I think they're not very resistant to dropping, because if you drop stuff, yeah, if you have the size you'd need to charge it, need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remote always get thrown around and stuff so yeah I think yeah practically I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes do they can't do yeah they do they yeah they've got dual things but the battery is smaller I think which one would last the longest because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day remote control like so yeah so if you if you had something using the standard batteries and the silent charging I don't think you'd I think they would you know how long the standard double A's would last in or just a charge from the attractiveness of the whole future yeah I think it would yeah okay can we add in attachment to clothing feature okay can we think about that because if we're doing the kinetic thing yeah shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I've got to think about right okay because if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape now the kinetic is something people don't do kind of we're doing something original and different and if you wore it if it's something you could just click on your pocket then you would have that less you wouldn't lose it yeah but then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of it it's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research it's not a thing that people are looking for okay let me throw it open to the field okay something to put on the side to think about it okay right okay well I'll move on my second part of my findings the most current remates use this silicon PCB board which print printed circuit board which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this LED and a sequence of on and off bursts what kind of things do we have to consider there can we what kind of slides does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size well the thing about it is that they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print a circuit board like that that it's it's simply space like that so you can have fit the size of the nine buttons in if you see how thin the tracks are you could you could you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one if you if you wanted to but the there is an option to do to do it like that or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit so that and then to yeah so to conserve battery life from most being a stamp I'm not while not being used and what I was thinking about that was because sometimes when when you have these things have got little lights on behind the buttons so you can see what all the buttons are like on a mobile phone they do it more often than on a on a TV remote but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds and not being used I'd have that turned off if we decided to go for buttons that could light up the case material I've been sent what the factory can actually give us the there's the plastic which I think we were going to go for anyway as the main case case housing and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think of the event practical titanium very expensive just the process which to make it is expensive and rubber where you're saying that people like this spongy feel this yeah so perhaps something made of rubber but I was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've said that they've put across are what is used in some stressful manufacture and it's meant to be anti-RSI I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said and the problem with the casing is that there's quite there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curve shapes but whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units for the flip phone yeah and second question is like mobile you can change the cover yeah yeah so in this case you be looking at like a custom again change the color like from green parrot green to chili red or something yeah is that feature available in like titanium or it's like only specific yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really the just it would well you could make it available in the titanium it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it because of the expense of how much titanium is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for it it does not quite easily to if you let it fall I've got a mobile for myself which is titanium and it does mark very easy yeah I'm just wondering if we make the basic mold out of plastic but have like a rubber cover yeah that you keep the spongy feel that also allows us to kind of have different and you can peel them off yeah instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic the fascia that comes like a rubber sleeve or a mask yeah yeah like those pens that you get with the grip yeah all right that could be good okay it could be comfortable to hold on very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one yeah yeah well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not yeah also the just just going back to the interface size with the buttons the I know we were planning to do some sort of touch screen now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare PCB circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colors and say just by touching it with your finger it would make the connection over if you had them close enough that would be one option the second option they offer rubber buttons but I thought that an LCD type of screen because one they're incredibly thin and don't take on much space to they you can have them in a sort of a rain you could arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of sat thing you could have them like a touch display oh what what just what you said I didn't get the meaning of it completely oh on the on the LCD screen you could you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curved things with it but you can you wouldn't have with the LCD you'd have the wires coming off you wouldn't have that with the with the LCD you don't have that with the printed circuit board with also sorry to interrupt I don't see why the curved thing is a problem if we for example had a shell yeah yeah you can have a flat screen inside yeah I'm just wondering whether we want an LCD screen inside it wouldn't be like full color it would just be black and white but they'd be touch touch buttons so you wouldn't be pressing down on all we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-ISON I think it would be good to have a contrast between if the whole thing rubber rubber is saying it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy yeah now how would you distinguish if you had it there how'd you distinguish where you had to press me yeah I hadn't really thought that another idea that helps with that but just to do with the RSI is it possible just as an option when we open it up people can use their fingers to press the button or we have inside like a small pointer thing yeah you could have some sort of stylus thing you could pull out but I think they could get there easily lost yeah easy to replace as well who's very often a person who switches channels very often does use a particular function very often yeah you'll find it very irritating to use yeah yeah and he might spoil the touchpad very fast compared to yeah yeah if you keep punching with an point over yeah okay just just thought they wouldn't actually need one in the could you anything they've got couldn't they have pan still a pan so they wouldn't really need a okay we'll talk quite that so if you finish here yeah that yeah that's the end okay before like your distance regarding the circuit since we have having a flip top yeah customized the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top oh yeah complex buttons in the distance so we can divide the circuit like yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple I mean you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them because in the in the actual flip that you'd have some linking I just raised another point well it occurs to me it kind of applies to both our designers here not sure how it would fit in if we flip open now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs there are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display you see those and they kind of respond to the turn of your body is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it's a little compact mirror when you press a button it then goes on to the phone display the out there remote control display thing we're marketing to guys as much as we are to women I don't look at himself just a thought well it's a remote control you were sitting watching TV yeah are you gonna want to sort of open it I know what you mean so without using the ideas mobile phones are kind of got tracked onto that I think okay just trying to think of other features we can build in it wouldn't cost too much but one would be that one on the side yeah I mean you can't you could do it you could have a because if you if you just put the full charge through an LCD display or completely blank it out I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it I think we forget about the mirror that was just a very quite passing so yeah okay I would like to show something which I did here first thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility second is we checked into competitors the picture who shows what are the standard models offered by computers here so you generally see there is not much of variety and like marketing teams said people need trendy they are both of black and white so you generally see rectangular shape very monotonous kind of designs here and second thing is there's too much of confusion here no particular remote is standard like some some people have here you see this this is on I found out that only common feature is the channel control and the volume control rest other buttons they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent with other models and okay and second as already discussed with William we are going to have maybe a GUI interface in the in the middle of the flip top and graphic user interface basically which is what we do in computer have icons are touchpad over to if yeah if you have like buttons appear on the screen and the cell CD screen like you have an all icons are something you have is a good example of GUI traffic user interface so basically a person need not point or click or press any particular device he just has to click on that particular icon that is simplified and on the top repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device that means user button so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent so we are having a combination of both so on this simpler board on the top we have this button rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels can we swap that round so the one that we use all the on the bottom part if you think about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press just like the mobile phone you don't have to flip it open and you'd be wouldn't you? not the idea if we just use the shell as an example again you open that you've got your LCD display there and you've got the buttons there she holds it that's what I was saying but you can't do it in the fun look and then have the LCD at the top and then be able to touch that for the other and you move into the volume and the program things like that and the lower the lower so the findings are too many clouded buttons repetition of certain buttons which I already explained example the volume and channel control buttons all are confusing and inconsistent of KV had a latest finding of voice recognition there was a male which mentioned that our division has developed a new speech recognition feature we have to check into the financial feasibility whether we can incorporate this at a low cost but for like we had response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it so it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers I am here yeah some kind of thing or it gives a blip sound some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also and technologically innovative also yeah so we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this my personal preferences would be like as already highlighted by marketing department they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say their design should be like a fruit but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colors like the vibrant colors are red chili yeah two mitre right over whatever and second thing is certain certain standard buttons we should have like for example if you see the previous slide wow yeah I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this certain central pattern here yeah so we would not change that particular pattern because this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls I can't see that that play and stop this is central one the one you have volume and channel so keep that standardize because that's the most common feature across all models if you look at all the models it's you this voice recognition right okay I'm not sure how long we've got left but we need to make a decision about things we discussed so we agree on do we agree on the battery yeah yeah that means that there's no function for the port you know that it sits in the impressive button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition yeah I think it's like a gadget yeah it is it is quite it's quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts are already in stock then it won't be cheap to remanufacturing or it will be cheap so to remanufacturing so do you recommend to get idea that where's the remote I'm here thing I think that would be quite fun I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost yeah that means we have to cut down somewhere else but I think pretty much we use cheap yeah to be cheap and simple thing yeah LCD's not cheap well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full color because if you just got black and white one I mean they use them in calculators maybe we could start with the black and white yeah we talked about kinetic charging we just seemed to have decided on that did we decide on double your triple batteries what you want like a backup no one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double your triple batteries because they still got to be charged this way haven't they know the kinetic one come come with the sort of watch a battery that goes in the watch right okay so it's a lot smaller so you want that okay okay got battery the inside components pretty standardized across the board yeah so there's not really a decision to be made there the buttons what did you give us the bear board LCD yeah I think we were going for the LCD on the on the on the on the top one okay you've got the touch yeah okay and then on the bottom we're gonna have to rub a rub once the anti OS islands okay okay sorry could you repeat that last part okay on the flip screen the flip screen the top one is gonna be the LCD and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberized but okay so the body design I think plastic plastic yeah okay inside for the inside and yeah rubber as a padding or for the grip something like to add to the design so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell variety of designs okay and it is just a always rubberized and spongy apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colors we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else we don't want to be tacky okay different shape anyway the fact the material that we would be using would be cheap we could make it red we could make it psychedelic you know we could make it black and white there for stripes but that's not really what we're focusing on what we're focusing on the feel yes so you just pick anything is that going to be the image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that maybe about that size made of plastic fits into the power of the hand rubberized cover that's spongy is that really going to fit fancy looking feel which was the major thing that people wanted market research is that's just different it's just different from everything else and I mean I'm trying to imagine being looking houses sort of beige and black do you either want something that goes with that which is what's on the market anyway or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than that chocolate yeah I'm just kind of pushing it that to see if you came out with anything else but I mean I totally agree we looked at those emotes I mean there are kind of anonymous very similar looking things this would definitely be different I just wanted if anybody could come up with something and you would just have a across the but you would have so many different options you could do you could have a plain black one you could have sparkly pink literally the things the rubberized covers are going to be serratively cheap to produce that if in a year's time we get feedback from the design fears that show something else is coming out it's so easy to be faster to produce that that can be slipped on and watch another beauty of it ones that have rubbery spikes you know just goes so far like a puffer face you could just you could take it wherever so I think that's quite a yeah flexible and finally the body should be detachable maybe you can change the body of the case kissing the case out it should be more loaded with the design in such a way you can change it every time yeah yeah with these rubber these rubberized okay not the actual plastic outside case just the rubber okay okay we've got five minutes um that might have been up for a while so can I just recap erasura for the decisions that we've made kinetic charging the watch type batteries LCD display on the top side of the flip top rubberized buttons on the bottom side we're going to use fruit and vegetable colors for the rubber cover the case itself is plastic that's how far we've got what else do we have to add to our decisions here we're talking of a wise recognition also because that we have not addressed the issue of how to locate remote control if it's lost yes we're just a cost issue with that but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost of maybe like William was suggesting the last thing some devices you put on key chains oh yeah yeah the whistle once so we can financially voice recognition is not visible we could go far away so and incorporating the company logo yep but we'll be incorporating on the design because I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from your report it's not just a case of having a little rr hidden somewhere they do want it to be obvious that it's our product well they do but I think we can since it's the only one of its kind on the market obviously going to be a news I think you just address that with advertising you associate the name with the individual product that it is okay and that doesn't work for you obviously you'll have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it the point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently I think it does did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper I think that was you talked about a beeper for location and we just rejected that and be the voice recognition depending on how yeah depending on the expense I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into yeah I've got in stocks that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we have to cut down somewhere else then it's worth thinking about but I think we'll find out more about yeah afterwards right going to back that day I got a end meeting now right? did it? I've been a bushing here so I think we've probably got instead of going to the thing we have 40 minutes so I think we've probably got about that time before we come back see that that or we only had 40 minutes to discuss what we've discussed I think we're pretty going in a clear direction now is everyone happy?
