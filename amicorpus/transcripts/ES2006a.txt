 Okay, so this is our first meeting of this design project and I am glad to show you the agenda for the meeting. I don't know if it was sent round to all of you. I don't know, anyway. This is the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly, although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already. Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more. Then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the course of the design project and the meetings, specifically the whiteboard over there. Then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan and discuss, come up with some preliminary ideas about it and then that's it. So we've got 25 minutes to do that until 11.25. So any questions? No, at this point. So this is our project. What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television. We want it to be something original, something trendy and also something user-friendly. So it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product. The method that we're going to use to complete the project that has three components as such. There's the functional design of the remote control. The way we'll do that I think is to work individually, initially and then come together for meetings to work on that. Similarly with the conceptual design, we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together. Then the detailed design will come after that. We'll pull it all together. I'm a bit confused about what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design. Is it just more detail? I think we're talking that the functional design is more your area of things where you'll be, we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what specific things it has to do, but the conceptual design is perhaps bigger than that and includes how people can use it and that kind of thing. Where do we identify the components of our product? I think it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify. It's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product. I think we'll start that initially with the functional design already. That's just a brief overview of the project itself. What I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for the project. Specifically, the whiteboard. Each person in turn, I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard, the pens just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what your favourite characteristics of that animal are. While you're doing that, tell us your name, what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project. Would you like to go first? I do have a choice. Oh, thanks for all the help. You don't have to hurry, we've got plenty of time. My name's Katz and I'm really not quite good at this whole drawing, but I like it. So, I always ruin it. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. I always ruin it. Okay, cool. She's a rabbit. At first I thought it was going to be Katz. I didn't think it's fair enough. I can see by that ears. It's a fluffy rabbit. It's fluffy. One day you'll be able to genetically modify them and they will come in pink. What's your role within the team? I'm the marketing expert. I'm going to be doing the appartling according to the little guy on the computer that knows everything. The user requirements specification, the functional design, trend-wotting in the conceptual design, and products of valuation in the detailed design. More about yourself. I'm from Leicester. What else do you want to know? I like sport. A very big kickboxing spinning. But not with rabbits. Not with rabbits. No, no. And bats. I like bats as well. And I like cocktails, especially people. My name is Marika. There's the pen. If you haven't got enough room, there's only a razor there. You can wrap it up. I'll make it smaller. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. It looks like a dog. I think it needs four legs if it's going to work. Maybe it has some coffee patches. I do like dogs because they are good friends. Two people and they are loyal. I like to compare to some other animals. They are really much more fun because they are not so independent. Maybe the fact that they protect their home as well. What it has to do with my role in the project is hard to say. I hope to be loyal to the project. I'm from Estonia. Yes. Is there anything else you would like to know? In the different stages of the design, I will be responsible for designing the technical functions of the remote control. In the conceptual design stage, I need to come up with an interface concept. In the last stage, I will be responsible for the interface design. Thank you. I will wrap the features. I will wrap the drawings. My name is Gaurav. My favourite animal is a cow. I have no idea how to draw a cow. This is going to be... Let me draw the body first. They would have long tails. They are like you. There is some grass there. This is what I like about. I don't disturb anybody. They are kind of put this in a way. I like cows. My role in the project is the industrial designer. I am supposed to design all the details of the product, how it works and whatever it will take. During the functional role, what are the various functions that have to be performed by it? During the conceptual design, what are the various components of it? Finally, I am not to show what was the last part. The detailed design, I guess, will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other. I am from India. I am doing my PhD in cycle linguistics. I sit at the department of psychology. Thanks. Now it is my turn. I will not be sweating. I am very cute. I like dogs too. I can't do that already because I can't do a dog as well as you can. Is that a lizard? No way. Wow. It's a gecko. Oh, a gecko. Okay. Is there a difference? Are they also like lizards or are they yet? Yes, they are kind of lizard. And I like geckos because they remind me of warm places. And where I was living in Cambodia, they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little geckos. I hope you don't like snakes. I don't like snakes. I go to Australia and we have nasty snakes. I am from Melbourne. And I am your project manager for today. And my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way. So that by the end of the day we come up with a great product. Wonderful. Okay. Thank you. So let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation. I thought about this that we could even put it much more proficiently. There we go. Okay. So this is the overall budget for our project. We have planning to sell these remote controls for, let's make that go away. That means we have got five minutes. We are planning to sell the remote controls for 25 euros each. And with that we are aiming for a profit of 50 million euros. And that's selling them on the international market, not just in the UK. So to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum 12 and a half euros so that we can reach that profit target. So that's something to keep in mind when we're designing. Okay. Let me just skip ahead to say that's the last thing. Okay. We've only got a couple of minutes. Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about what we're thinking of this? Yeah, I'm just wondering whether there is like any special feature that we want to have. Want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones. I think that's probably something that it's best if we take away with this. But if we all have a think when we go away from the meeting what specific things could be included in this remote control. I think in the beginning one thing was that was mentioned was that should be trendy user friendly and original. So I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this. Yeah, I was looking at the website and the other things that they've made and I like put down some inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures. So the motto is we put the fashion in electronics and so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional. So I'm kind of thinking like those phones that they have the new generation ones where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that. All right. I think I'm getting towards that so it's not overly. I mean, I don't know what most of them do on my own account. So I think I have medium age, you know. So perhaps I'm sort of menu based thing on something that's a little less crowded than this. Like, I mean, theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your TV. Yeah. But what do most people do? They turn it on. They watch certain specified channels. Yeah. And then they turn it off again. There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used 90% of the time. But will be used 10% of time. There's no need to have buttons on it to do that. Maybe to do it could be one button for a menu or something that's used. Yeah. And then use that. So if you're a kind of sad case that knows how your Macintol works, then you know, that's fine. And you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have these buttons which is confusing. Excellent. Because like if you look at the train, it's just very like there's no extra bits on it, the train on the website. I don't know if I haven't had that before. But it is just like a long, like thing used to moving people, but it looks really pretty too. Great. Any other immediate thoughts? We can aim for, I mean we can think about all these little things, but we can aim for something that gives a high battery life. Although I don't think that it's a huge problem for a more controlled, and even battery life every now and then you need to replace the batteries. Yeah. But I mean, even though it has to be original, we shouldn't go like too far away from the usual ones because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with learning. Yeah. So it should kind of fit in as well. Like it's fancy with a teeter type of a. But you can't access because you have no idea how to get in, but the design is not very great. Okay, so we need to wrap it up now so that we can go and get on with some of this. We've got another meeting in 30 minutes. So you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace. So basically you're looking at the working design. You're looking at the technical functions design. And for you it's the user requirements specification, like I said at the start. Okay. Okay, thanks for that. Thank you. I'll see you in half an hour. See you. Carry the laptops back again. Do we need to unplug things? Probably.
