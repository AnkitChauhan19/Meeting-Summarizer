 Hey. Okay. Hmm. So okay. I don't know where it's but it's been. Okay. Is that alright? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right. Oh, another one. So that's this. Oh, okay. Right. Are we free to take notes? I don't know. I'm not going to say so. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just hang on a second, everybody. I haven't let you look at this yet. Very nice. I haven't looked at it but let's just start it off. Hey, we'll see what happens. If you're ready. Okay. It's the agenda. Opening acquaintance, tool training, project plan, discussion, and then closing. Project A is a new remote control. It's original, it's trendy, and it's user friendly. Project method, functional design, individual work, and then a meeting. Conceptual design, individual work, and a meeting. Details, design, individual work, and a meeting. Tool training. Try out the whiteboard. Every participant should draw their favorite animal and sum up their favorite characteristics of that animal. Okay. Miss industrial designer, would you like to go first? So we're supposed to bring the little things for the... Yeah, I think just click. Do you have a belt? I'll put them in your pocket. Yeah. Okay. So my favorite animal? Yeah, what's your favorite animal? Okay. Ah. Is it rude? An elephant. That's a very good elephant. Oh my gosh. I've never got a new straw that well. Okay, and you want to write up on there, so you've got to sum up your favorite characteristics of that animal. Okay, it's big. It's got a great memory. Is it? Oh, it's supposed to have a great memory. You say an elephant never forgets. And I don't know why, but it looks like nice to me. Okay. Wonderful. Well done. Do you want to use the wiper and... Wiper off? And... Is that a aesthetics designer? Do you want to go next? I've applied to your favorite animal. Okay, my favorite animal. Let's see. Oh. I don't know if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before. It's a Lager. What? A combination of a lion and tiger. All right. You've not seen Napoleon Dynamite. No, no, it's a hilarious memory. You have to see it. And it's best characteristic is... And it's pretty much the awesomest animal. But you have to see the movie, the fully appreciated. Okay, well done. Great. Me? Yeah. Miss Mark Singh? Okay. I'm going to show how this is going to work. Cool. Well, I'll try my best to draw... Can I just draw the face? Yeah, I think you can just draw the face, but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks. It's a cap. That's a very... Which also has a big fat body and... A long tail. Do you want to do some... Right. Do you want to just write some words about it? Why? Because... Cuddly. And usually caps are very friendly, usually. And the healing law, the heal. And they can feel when a human's... Wow. Problems. They're kind of spiritual. That's why I like caps. Oh, done. There we are. Sleep. Do do do do do. Okay. I don't actually have a favourite animal for the... For the... I think I'll draw... A little... I honestly can't draw for toffee. Really? Yeah. In fact, nope. It's just... This is a prairie dad. Nope. That's cool. That's exactly what it is. Not a very good one. Not bad, I would say. Yeah, that's pretty good. Okay, well you got it. It's a... It's a squirrel. And... I like them because they're cute. And stupid. Very good. Ah. Alright. Right. Okay. So, I guess that was the test to see if this equipment was all working. And let's move on to the next page. Okay, project finance. Selling price is 25 euros. I bet aim... 50 million euros. I can't read internationally. Full. Yeah. Production costs... Ah, it's got a bit... Ah. I'll cost any more than 1250 to make. I'm going to... I'll experience with... with remote control. So, I talk about who... Who's used block? Any ideas? Stuff like that. Next meeting starts in 30 minutes. At... Courage to 12. I think before we close, we're expected... I mean, the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer with our... What our ideas were... I mean, if you want to go back to the last slide. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think we're... I mean, before we close the meeting, we're supposed to come up with some ideas for... Oh, so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now. Yeah. Oh, okay. I thought this was just... given us instructions for the... to do next. Yeah, I think this is just the preliminary... get some rough ideas for... what our experiences with remote controls have been... and what we would... roughly what we would incorporate into a new one, maybe. Okay. All right, who's got experiences with remote controls then? For anybody else, everybody. We have our guests. Is this a TV one we're supposed to make? Yeah. Yeah, it's a TV remote control. Okay. Okay. A new remote control TV. What would I like? What? You want a big, do you want a small? Medium. Are we going for like... like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we're going for something that's... that's big and... That seems like there's like... there's sort of a tension between two ideas. I mean, you want... you want one remote that maybe can work all of the functions of TV. And if you have whatever associated with the TV, the DVD player... Video. But at the same time, you don't want a really busy... remote with a thousand buttons on it or something. Maybe... Yeah, I'd... I'd say other things is it's going to be cheap. Yeah. Because I... I mean, I was thinking something that's got different... like maybe a... an LCD display on it that's got different pages for different devices. But that would... that would probably be quite expensive. But how do we know how much... I mean, how much do we have per... How much? It can't be more than $1.250 per unit. Per unit, yeah. Cast. So do we have to be realistic within the budget for... Well, at the moment, we could... I mean, because we... this is what we're doing at the moment. It's just saying what we'd like. And then after we... after we found out what we can like, some different ideas... we can then go and do the research to find out if these... any of these ideas are feasible or not. So it would be nice to have something that controls lots of different things. But we have like... one that comes out. Like, so you have one in... like, it doesn't have to be really thick. I mean, rock controls can be thin bits. And then you have one for your DVD and you sort of slide it out. You have another one, you slide it out. So it slides. And then it all comes compact. Okay, that's a lie. Into one. So it's not... you're actually just putting three or four different remotes together... but making them thinner. And into one. Basically. That's an idea. So you just split them out. Okay. But have one very complicated one on one side with all the DVD and VCR... excess and stuff. And then on the other side, one... a remote control, though, would be very, very simple. It's just the channel program plus and minus. And then just the mute button, for example. I can really, really, really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated. One side for kids, one side for adults. I'm actually... Or grandma as well, you know. I'm going to show you if it's a good idea to have a two-sided remote control, because it would be very hard to use in the way that you... No, but you would slide it into something... like something on the back would hold... like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons. Like, or something like a flip telephone. Something like that, maybe. That'd be cool. I think you flip it open and you've got all the buttons or you flip it closed and you've just got their basic buttons on the outside, maybe. Oh, we've got five minutes left. It's still breaking up. Okay. Well, we've got a few ideas there. Yeah, we should... I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a rough conceptual. I mean, what was stage one was technical functions designed, what effect the apperata should have. Okay. So, I mean, we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface. But the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the TV but also devices connected to the TV. Yeah. We'll be able to operate DVD players, things like that. I've got... I think we should also have a backup plan of... I just think that it might be expensive to make something that... I mean, we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything. We should have a backup plan of just a really good television remote control. It's just for a TV but it's just a really good, nice one. What you reckon? Yeah. It's because I'm just thinking, apparently, we have to have something that's cheap to make. Yeah, that's true. Maybe we should just concentrate on having a good TV remote and have it be... I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker. Have it be like ergonomic, it's comfortable to use, simple to use, and looks decent. We know maybe... We'll make it... We'll make it interesting for people to buy, though. Well, maybe even something that's for disabled people or some people that don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for finding niche for our remote, like market it to a certain kind of people. Oh, just one that looks really fucking cool. Yeah, no, I think you're right. Could we really lie to... I don't know if it's something special. Yeah, rather than focus on... Otherwise, we'll be... We'll be here all day talking about how to do this and do that. I think we should... It will be the end of the day if it says just TV remote doesn't say combination at all. Yeah, I mean, obviously everyone... You know, it sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once, but remote's spinning out from other remotes. Yeah, having a little nested remotes and say, yeah, that's right. Yeah. I mean, I'd like one that makes tea as well, but that's not gonna happen. I think a flip-up thing, because you always have this problem of like... On this... Well, I didn't know it. Like, we had five or six remotes and they'd be lying on the couch and you'd come and sit down and... Oh, the television switch down or something. So maybe something that like... Does have a lid or closes so you don't accidentally press a button or... Okay, like a lot... Like a lot... Function on it like you have when you're telephones. Yeah. But make it like really snazzy and cool with people who want it, so make it, yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be sellable. Yeah, that's true. I mean, it doesn't have to have a flip function. It can just have a lot of functions in it. Yeah. Not usable when you don't want it to be used. Yeah. Okay. And even for kids as well, it's safer for them, I guess. Like, they don't flick onto channels that are not allowed to. They flick onto. No porn channel for children. Okay. All right, so we've got some ideas. I guess that's move on. That's move on. That's good for them. Oh, that's close. That makes me... What does ID, VID and ME stand for? Industrial designer. Okay. Which is... These are kind of specific. And on marketing. Yeah, there you go. So let's... Use the interface designer. That's... That's me. That's... Okay. That's you. So you're going to... You're going to be the one that's working out what buttons we need. Right. Industrial designer. You're the one that... You're going to be working out. Kind of box it goes in, I guess, or... Whether it's... I... What goes into the box somehow? How it works. And the marketing... These are quite... These are quite... So what the user requires... Yeah, what? And the art too, kind of... Right, okay, yeah. Yeah, it does seem like... I guess. You two... You two are going to... I think you just double... Yeah. You're working together. You're the one that's going to go and find out... Do the research. See what people want in a remote. What buttons are used more often and stuff like that. Oh, we've been warned to finish the meeting now. Okay. Okay, everyone. Well done. Good meeting. All right. See you in 30 minutes. Yeah. So... Do we take this off? I don't...
