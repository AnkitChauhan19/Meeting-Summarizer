 This is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting. Again, I'll take minutes. What we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from the presentation. So, diligently. There's a record that in Katz going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this again. Then I need to say since a few things about finance because we have to check that it's within the process of production and design. We've got 40 minutes. And then we get to make a link in Katz. Because we missed out. So, it's now, I guess that was supposed to start with the 35. So, we've got until 4. So, we've got 40 minutes. And then we get to make a link in Katz. Because we missed out. So, it's now, I guess that was supposed to start with the 35. So, we've got until 4. How much do we have? 40 minutes. Yeah, about 40 minutes. I'll tell you about 40 minutes. So, yeah. Okay. So, is it, are we starting with the, yeah. So, will you maybe start with the shape and things. And then I will explain the, they use interface, things like the buttons and the screw. Okay. So, basically going without trend of vegetables and we selected the color and approximate shape of banana. I think the banana is the same thing to use with the panic. So, it's just an approximation. Do you use perfect? You were making color. Does it vibrate when you press the button? Sorry. So, basically it's the flip open thing again. So, we have the, okay. The maricover will explain you the user interface there. And it flips open on the side. So, it opens like that. And we have the user interface in here and the LCD and the school inside. Well, everything else is probably user interface. And it's the whole thing made of rubber. Oh, yeah. It is. Yeah. Do you make every smaller one? It could be made a bit smaller and of course it will be shiny. Yeah, but one thing we actually kind of forgot while designing it. One side was supposed to be rounder. So, is it the backside? Well, since it's made of rubber anywhere, I think it's... Yeah. It does look like the front's like curvy and then the whole shape's curvy. So, I would say that it's curvy. It looks quite like a vegetable. Yeah. And it's spongy as well. So, I keep them. So, they're using the face as we discussed last time on the cover. We just have the very basic things. We have that channel here starting from 1, 2, 3. There would be numbers on the actual one. So, it's 4, up to 4, up to 7, up to 9 and 0. 0 here. Yeah. And then, well, this is on off button. It's quite standard place for it. And also the colour is quite often read. So, it's kind of user friendly. And then, these ones would be for flipping the canals back in like the previous one and the next one. And we would also have a little thing saying here, previous and the preven. Where's the volume? The volume is scrolling on the side. You can't see it. This one. You can get that. And it's on the back cover or back lead. Because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here. Okay, can I see. So, the volume is you just scrolled. But then once you flip it open, there you have the screen. And you have the spinning wheel with options to choose. You can move back and forth. And then, if you need to choose something on the screen, you just push the middle button. Oh, the thing we forgot was like a mute button. A mute button. We will have this on the screen on the display. So, on the cover, we have the barest and the wheel. On the wheel if you flip it. On the wheel down, then it will. On the LCD, you know, the main one, you will have a bit of a... But the scrolling is kind of, you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right? But if you're all the way to the scrolling, isn't it? That's a scrolling click. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And so, the whole mutation. Yeah. And okay, so the voice recognition is also just part of it. You can't really see it in the interface. Yeah, it's hidden in there. And we do have the logo. Very good. So, I think, and it's with the black and yellow in the right hand. Yeah. So, yeah. Yeah, I think we could do the logo in gray as it is on the website. Yeah. So, you can have a look. Yeah. I can't. I can't. I can't. So, it's an intermediate color like it. Yeah. Oh. I'm holding it. It is the golden slamming. I hate play days with minions. Yeah. Oh, that's cool. They're in clip. Okay. So, maybe if we go on to evaluation criteria, again, we'll... I suspect we're going to have a couple of minor finance issues. But we'll see. I'm sure we can get around them somehow. We'll just send all of them and the factory into some nice poor country. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the only process. Yeah. Wow. Wow. For example. Cool. Okay. Right. Okay. Okay. Okay, cool. So what we're going to do is prepare the evaluation of the new design. So we're going to be using the 7.0 scale. So one is, you know, yes, it totally meets what that requirement and 7 is, no, it really doesn't. We need to go back and start again. You know, basically what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and made a list of them, you know, so that we can evaluate each one and like, so it's about going back to the start and saying, oh yeah, we did manage to do that or I don't know, we really forgot about that. Cool. So these are what they are. So we're going to put each of these we need to give it a 1 to 7. Yes, I did have a B C and D down here, but it seems to attend to like just a lot of us. Never mind. Okay, but if you can imagine that they say A B C and D, that would be really good. I guess we'll give it a good maximum point in everything. Yeah, yeah, it's definitely attractive. Yeah, I agree. I was a locatable thing, we actually forgot. Well, I thought you'd kind of said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the TV. Yeah. So I just prepared to prepare one now. Yeah, I've got to be rich. Cool. Okay. So be attractive to look at. That's this one. What do you all say? Seven was the maximum. Yeah. Yeah. I go for seven. Yeah. We're all so proud of the calendar. Okay, so be attractive to look at. That's this one. What do you all say? Seven was the maximum. Yeah. Yeah. I go for seven. Yeah. We're also proud of the calendar. Okay, so that will be a seven. I'll know you can't wash that stuff there. Okay. I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in. Excellent. Excellent. We can't. Yeah. I can take notes. I'll take a note. Okay, so we're all agreeing on seven. Cool. Okay. Does it match the off-wating behavior of a user? I think it does. Yeah. The only thing that we were considering was that this thing is kind of more for right time. Yeah. So we might want to do like another model, another version which is like exactly the mirroring match of this one. Yeah. That's going to be a problem because you don't always have all left handers or all right handers in a family. Yeah. I think it's not a huge problem because I think left handed people already used to discrimination anyway. So they just... Yeah, but I mean because it's not like it's a pen, you know, left handed people can't normally write, write a hundred, but they can normally do most things, write a hundred, say. Right. I would say it's not such a big issue. Yeah, because I mean anyway right handed people would be able to scroll with them. Yeah. So if the majority are right handed... I mean, you think of it to scroll rather than you thumb. Yeah. So I mean that does kind of negate the whole RSI issue. So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation. I'll give it a little bit of RSI, what do you think? Or maybe six because it's just one, one in one of the... Yeah, I think for, I mean most people are right handed so in terms of our greatest target group, I think it's pretty good. Yeah. One more thing is that... When more things are planned for management, they might want to... Okay. It might be a little clumsy when it opens up, right? Or it opens on the side. No, yeah, but we have it nicely with our hinge with her what yeah yeah so it won't be a problem it will be and it will be it won't be heavy I think the alternative is flipping from the top yeah but it's a bit long kind of really a little bit long well I mean it can be open like this of course you were thinking about making it smaller yeah this is just like this makes more fun so you have to do it might interfere with the higher channel yeah but if we flip it open only ask much us that okay so it works like a mobile phone flipping but you know as long as that side flat then that will work okay okay so see oh are we admitting defeat on sea or are we saying we're gonna stick locate on the sea no we have a look at that there's a located cool so that's just take that TV that does mean you need to speak on it yeah well but but the speak sample speakers included so it has some capacity to do yeah so yeah so that's seven years yeah yeah fabulous day intuitive completely intuitive if this means intuitive if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's yeah I think it's six because I mean the the standard layout for numbers is 333 and one rather than the way you've got it I really like the way you have it yeah it's not the immediate thing that you used to yeah and I mean and even the scroll it's a new technology so might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginning so it is kind of not very intuitive but it's a good technology I mean something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places and so should we maybe say a five and say it is intuitive but it's different so yeah do you know I mean it's obvious how to use it but you might have to think about it first so we give that one a five do you think yeah can't give us seven and everything so yeah I'm glad you were accepting this I have taken a little while haven't I'm intuitive but sorry it's really hard to write on this I just went a bit mad didn't I okay cool E okay I guess this comes back from this whole B thing links in here so possibly for left-handed investigate yeah but otherwise it's superb so she give it a six six six the ergonomic design well I mean I don't know I mean the repetitive stress things but then who would be really pushing the button so much on the remote control anyway yeah yeah unless you are all the time sitting yeah so it's kind of yeah I think it is a lot of it you know and I never got the repetitive strain injury from that so I find it quite hard to believe you know and more of it it has the LCD and everything so that you know we minimize the pressing of the buttons anyway okay so we give that six yeah okay yeah have more that's absolutely I want to have a make showing up with the things there but it only have full of points there oh that's the second one so you must have changed it on this one where it's got score but not on the previous slide oh okay cool um right it has voice control yes so that's a seven then key in a way yeah in a while it's the most sophisticated mode that I've ever seen yeah but in terms of the actual technology none of it is actually well we have we have the sample speakers yeah yeah I mean all of the components have been used in other things before but at the same time they all they're all relatively new they've never been used in remote control before I didn't think yeah yeah yeah do you think six six I mean how how far can you go with our remote control really well that's it still has to do what it has to do yeah yeah but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really haven't it see many we've faced remote they can take it with them put fashion in electronics yeah it's in a touch on yeah sure the carrot banana it's the maximum we give it seven fruit and vegetables are fashionable they stay so okay so I think that's a fun one but good we need the average here so you know they ever reach us about six and something yeah a little bit over six there are how many six things a little bit under six that's 28 three sixes and one five 18 oh three sixes okay yeah 28 38 or four seven six 26 and five 61 21 to weigh six point something yeah about six point five six point five and close enough yeah okay that's pretty good I think now I won't until we get to find out if we can afford it that's all you've got at the moment or did you have anything there now that's it yeah all right so finance and we'll see if we can unscrew this fast would you get it? cool things I'm just gonna just get there again there's a Mud beautiful not in the culture If you have to wait for it? You have to wait for it. Okay, so we've looked at the project at presentation and the simulation criteria. Now we have to calculate the production costs. So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that. Can you read that? Almost. I started feeling at the end, but of course these are provisionals that we have to go down. No hand dynamo, right? No simple battery, no kinetic energy, no solar. The chip we're going for an advanced chip on print. We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker. Single curved surface, so that we can evolve it. Case material we said rubber oven. I don't know what special colour means. I think this is probably special colour. Rubber comes, rubber comes. Maybe if you want titanium colour, or maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing. Yeah, you might end up having to take off. We have a pushback and then we have scroll wheel as well. So we had from using yeah, and we have LC display and buttons supplements. No. We're not giving any more. Yeah, but we have LC display, but the ceiling will be there. Maybe it's integrated with LC display. I think the push button. I don't know if that's why. I mean you can only have 25 push buttons in two to do that, not counting anything. So we put it. What is the limit? Whether push button means that we have to count all of our passion. I don't think so. No, it says what is the kind of interface? If it is push button, then you got a 0.5, it's a scroll wheel. So we put it's push button and scroll wheel and LC display. So that's the three kind of interfaces that we have. So as we can see, that's way too expensive. What's our budget? 12.5. Yeah, the sample center will have to go because that's my sister. So that has implications for the. It does not have four wise recognition, but it does have for the feedback speaker. When you press one, it says one or it says hello. That's a bit of a gimmick anyway. And the locator also goes away. But it was very innovative. So innovative. Well, I mean, the sample speaker is expensive, but we could just have some very easy device that just beeps. Yeah, because the sample speaker was, I think, more complicated than the other. But yeah, there you record your samples. Yeah. Also, in the case, I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface because it's just rubber. So it's probably a flat surface rubber. Okay. Yeah. So we need 150 off. See, I was going to say the scroll wheel push button thing because take it down to just a scroll. That means that we cannot press. Yeah, then we will be in the budget in the LCD. If in the LCD, we can scroll right. How do we make a selection if you cannot push this one, but we don't have a push button. We don't have this muting mechanism for this. Well, you just have to scroll it straight down. So that's the point. But hey, it's the scroll wheel. I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and push button thing. But I mean, we can put an additional mute button on the top as well. Yeah. I mean, that wouldn't actually cost anymore. That's the spin wheel, though, isn't it? And that comes with the LCD. That comes with the LCD. Yeah. So we are adding costs for both, right? Okay. I mean, I think it's the good. So we're pointing three over. I think we're over at the moment. Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have push button to the volume. We can still put them on the side. Yeah. I mean, the scroll wheel is pretty cool, but... Instead of scrolling here, we have two buttons here of rough and down. Yeah. For the side. Sounds good, actually. Yeah, rather than having three different things that people have to do. Okay. There we go. Oh, look, we're way under budget. We'll make huge profits and we'll get bonusy. And we'll be kidded to the single curve this time for me. So we're going to have a little bit of a special colour. Yeah. So that's all right. We'll leave it at that. Yeah. And then I'll take it. I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour. If that costs extra, we've still got some space for it. We have. Yeah. Excellent. All right. So did we lose on our evaluation criteria? No, I'm not really. You know, because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep LCD display. Yeah. Instead of having scrolling, we just put it in the back. We just show what is the gimmick. There's never now anyway. Yeah. And this scroll wheel is, I mean, essentially the two buttons that is, is not very different. Yeah. All right. But we lose the locator. Well, we are going to have a beeping thing. So instead of the speaker. Yeah, it's not like sample speaker, but it will just beep. So we still have the little key. Yeah. That's not very exciting colour. I think you should make it more vegetable-like. Much colour, the colour of the phone or the colour of the... Oh, the beeper thing. Well, it can be yellow as well, it can come in the same colour as the case. We won't have run out of that. Yeah, I think general sits over our rate. You know, your pen for a rate? Yeah, I know. I know, I have my pen. But only for a very short time. Okay. So it looks like we designed a banana. We've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting. So it would be good if we could just have a little talk about their project itself and how it went so that we can feedback to the management for next time the design of the product. Cool. Feedback, I do. Yeah, as far as creativity is concerned, yeah, I think there was room for creativity. The only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the budget we had. I think one thing that was lacking was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with. Yeah. And we kept adding things randomly. Yeah. So how do you know? If we don't have the sheet at the beginning, you should have been like, okay, so we can have that lots. Yeah, yeah. We can have that lots. Yeah, yeah. So all the random decisions at the end could have been. Yeah. But in terms of the process of going and working individually and then coming back to the meeting, that works. I think it means to say regular, you know, it wasn't like we were alone for very long. So you didn't go off and think, wouldn't it be great to have a fine meeting? I think we could talk. Shape like a banana. And then, you know, come back, feed it, you'll eat it again. And look, look, get by bait and it looks like a banana. Yeah. Yeah, the means were very, very good. The means we used. The whiteboard digital pen. And the pens. I like the pens. I want one. That would just be so cool to do. You know, you could take it to lecture and just black stuff down. Yeah. I think that's it. I wonder what one of these costs. Do you think they've noticed it one day? Maybe you should say that was the recording. Okay. It covered my camera. Yeah. But that worked well having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint. Because I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it. It is a bit too late, isn't it? Yeah. And this time also, the time in the way to actually preparing them. The thing flew in. You didn't have the whole pushing thing because there wasn't time for that. Yeah. That's alright, otherwise it would have been tough. Not that you can do that on the board either. You can make some of it. Yeah, but I mean already just, just preparing the slides before the whole day. Yeah, totally. I mean, I'm just fairly tight. Anyway, I mean, especially with that last minute alteration. Yeah. And you can see the brackets. This has just had to be changed. And yeah. It's very cool. Yeah. We used to say nice things about gender. You don't move until I'm asked if you can. Yeah. I was satisfied with what I needed to. Yeah, definitely. You were in like a dictating reader. Yeah, that was always good. You have to say that because I'm taking the note. I leave the room and you can leave it in the night. And then you've got the pen. You want a tag here, then. And then the teamwork, I think it worked quite nicely. Yeah, to anyone feel that they were getting covered up. And not being able to express them. I guess it was a fairly small group. So all of us got to express our opinions. New ideas for me. Well, it's pretty new, pretty novel solution for remote control. I think the most controlled really, all this flipping open thing. I didn't know I didn't do shopping for my controls. I would have never seen anything. None of my examples were like this. Yeah. I'll be looking up next time I need to be an essay. I'll be exploring. Maybe we could have a patent on this one. Patent patent patent patent. I think the idea has been evil. We've got nowhere to find here. Well, you can always go to Google and type in the Nana Remote Control. The vibrate. The vibrate. Yeah, but that would just come up with like, the thing to nothing. True. Okay. So costs are within budget. Yes. Within budget. Including one of the got one euro left over. Bit that we didn't foresee. We've evaluated. Yes, the project. You've got the scores. Can you put that in the project documents? It's in the project now already. And the process we all didn't really have an emergency gobbling to. Was there anything that you found difficult or anything that didn't go as smooth as? My mind difficulty was the time pressure. Otherwise, sometimes it was like a little bit less. I thought that was good though, because if you're given too much time, you've got nothing to do with your time. Although we could have made the hours better, had we had time for you? Yes. Okay. I think we're still ready. I've got about five minutes left, but if we finish, then we're finished. Which is too efficient. We should never drag a meeting on just because we have extra time. Yes, so I would say that's the end of that meeting. It was a pleasure working with you. It was very productive. We took four animals on the board again. I don't think so. It can make some animals. It's just me and it smells so bad. Doesn't it? It smells very sweet. So we have to complete the final questionnaire meeting summary when they... Is there a questionnaire already sent? No, it was a bit... I can see it a bit. I can't see why you can't stay here. I can't see it. I'll put that side this way. I make your animal for you. It was supposed to be pink. Yeah, but it was little...
