 I'll set. Okay, cool. Right, so basically I'm just going to go over real quickly some news I just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control and then I'm going to turn it over to you guys to make brief presentations on what you found and then we'll have a bit of discussion. So basically I've just found out from the board on if you guys got the email as well but it needs to be television only. So we're not doing DVD, we're not doing anything else, it's just going to be a television remote. It also needs to have the company colors included in it. So that's red and black and it has to have the slogan. In case you guys forget the slogan it's we put fashion and electronics and no teletext. I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do so we don't want to include that in this particular design for reasons that I don't really know this but it's the board so there you go. So basically given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean because it's television only we will be able to change our well we can sacrifice more function for a better television remote. So I'm going to turn it over to the industrial designer to go ahead and make a presentation. So do I unplug you in this bit here? Yep. It's going to come up. Okay. Right. That's page one of my presentation. So the method we're going to have to understand how remote controls work and we're going to say successfully complete this project. Remote control works as follows. It's all pretty basic stuff for you guys. It sends a message to another system so there's an energy source involved in that like battery or solar power. Something along those lines. There's an integrated circuit just the microchip and that actually composed the messages and usually the way a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system. User interface controls the chip basically that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as well. So my findings I just did a preliminary study here and I found that too much metal and remote design can potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands and too much metal can cause remote to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals. Too much metal is sometimes people pick up radio signals and the like and there's lots of the possibility of remote catching on fire and injuring the customer. Just think of those lawsuits now would be really bad. Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction. Components just some ideas that I had energy source. It's kind of hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup. The user interface I was, since we can't use metal, I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic. The chip silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that. We can't really be different in that respect. The sender, while I'm thinking infrared because it is the industry standard multi channel that's the word I made up. I don't really know what it means. Pal and NTSC compatible and probably a 200 foot range. And the receiver of course is a number of electronic devices. But in this case the only VTBs. Personal preferences. I really think that we should use plastic as a post metal company simply kind of forward this kind of lawsuits. Which admittedly is going to come at the cost of certain aesthetic value because we were thinking. Is there a way that we can use modern types of polymers or modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value? Like if we talk about like on the laptop on these laptops and other things, it's a pretty nice. Is there some kind of nice color there in quality, plastic that we can work with? Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem. For example, the plastic they have in the laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do. Great. Thank you very much, Nathan. If next we can have the user interface developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that would be great as well. Let's plug yourself in here. Hit functioner fade real quickly. Hold down. Is it plugged in while? There it goes. Periodjustice. Sweet. Well, so here we have my technical function design presentation. So, a few of the requirements we need here. We basically need to operate an electronic device. It needs to be universal. And possibly operate several different types of devices, although we now find that. Yeah, sorry, I couldn't get that get to you before I know from. So, some of my findings basically want to send messages to a television set. That would be any number of different things such as switch on the television such as an external, that sort of thing I think we're all quite intelligent and know what a normal remote control does. Now, some of the other things I found is a complicated remote control. I'm sorry that we can't wait. We might read there very well that this remote control has many functions. So, it can do a lot of things, but it is quite complicated and most users will find it. Find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't want to take the time to learn how to do it. As you also notice, it's quite a boring design. Another remote control slightly different. It's a simple remote control. Many less buttons, but has many fewer functions. Much easier for the user to manipulate and use. It also has a bit of a cheap look and is also quite boring. So, my personal process is revolutionized the idea of a remote control. So, attain the functionality of a complicated device, but use a simple format of display for the user to work with. Now, it's going to add another slide here, but I didn't play half time there. Okay, just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously, like having multiple faceplates and one. Great, thanks for that run. I mean, that's you. I think so. Okay. I can plug you up. Oh, that would be perfect. Thank you. Slide down. Or it not? Give it a little bit. Okay. So, this is me. Basically, I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got. We had a usability test where we were actually, like watching 100 people use TV remotes and see what it is that they're using. And then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general TV remote control practices. And then we were able to do so much through testing. We were finding out that most of the time everybody's just using changing the channel, turning it on, using the volume. The majority of the time that's all that's going on. The other functions happen for some people. They're important, but the primary uses are really, really basic. And so big, complicated remotes, like one we saw in the last presentation, are really not the general public's use. They don't need it. They even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons they don't want to do with. And we also found out that 50% of our people, they're the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it. And then they can't find it in the room. So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, we're really coming to play with a lot of these people. There's also a survey about what they liked about the remote. And pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful. And the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options. I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically. That's up to the design people. But it is something we're thinking about, especially since the younger demographics obviously the one that's going to keep growing. So if that's the direction we're headed in, it's something to think about. But basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice, which are the standards. So it's a good start for us. That's great. Thank you, Sarah. Right. So yeah, I'll just switch that back here. I'll finish up, which is a bit of discussion. I'll plan on for the next phase. Right. So I think we've covered most of these important questions through this. Through you guys' presentations. We've got the industrial designer suggests, or pretty much, infatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. Sarah, she's recommended that we go for simple or functions. So fewer functions. But we need to decide who we're selling this to. Your stat suggested that 75% of people under 35 want to thought about voice control. So do we want to go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic? And my thought is we've got, if we're going to go for a sleek look, I mean we are putting the fashion and electronics. We're not catering to the pensioners of the world that we'll take. So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic. So we need to wonder how we can make it better and smaller and faster. We're constrained to plastic very well. We've got this idea. We're almost saying we need to think about revolutionizing the way it's looking. Which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for tele. So this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea. Assuming that it's doable. At least for the basic controls. Maybe we can balance it that way. We can see, okay, you can't say record alias tonight. We might be able to say volume up. Right. I think it'd be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology. Oh, that could work. I like that. With a simple command like locate. Yeah. Something very basic. It could start to be. Right. Or before we found. Is that only going to be within our 200 foot range then? Oh yeah, I think that's right. The difficulty what would be in I think like it. You couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find. Can you have something that picks up? A voice from far away. It's a good point. It's hidden under the couch. But then again, you have this we this we think, you know, they're just a little chip or whatever that has the page button. Maybe that could be always activated too. A little sticky pad to stick on top of your television. Yeah. And you say something to that. Yeah. Yeah. Or an isolated magnet or something like, you know, something that wouldn't interfere. I don't know the technical thing. But yeah, I like that. I like that. The voice recognition to the paging system. The thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control. So it could be sold to both the younger market, the older market. The younger market could use kind of the voice control method. The older market might make it just option. Exactly. And we might consider the older market could use this in poor design, but the traditional buttons and whatnot. I was thinking. You know what the screen, sorry. I'll go ahead. If we're going to do this touchpad screen thing, and we still do we know if that's an option technically right now. Definitely an option. I've looked into a cost of touch screen and whatnot. This is to be, you know, almost as cheap as a button method at this point. It seems like an interesting option, especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these, you know, four or five basic functions. And you have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition settings. Things that you're not going to use every day and that a lot of people aren't going to use, but it is an option there for this high tech market that sort of be. Is this leak thing we're going for? I've got a wonder there for adding so much technology to this one remote. I was still going to be able to meet a 12 or 12 50 euro gold for selling these things. It seems like you're not going to be able to handle all those functions with just one microchip. The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the whole mechanism. Yeah. It's just something to consider. Absolutely. Okay. Well, yeah, I guess we'll cross that bridge in a later stages of development. But yeah, no, it's perfectly viable question. Okay. So I'm seeing that we're going to just basically focus on this young demographic. Aim it at them, but then in a sense that it's bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them, but basically we'll make a sleek, simple functioned. Remote control. I think this voice recognition thing is we've got a market for it. I don't think there's too many. We more or less be cornering the market on as well. We don't have many. Yeah. Compared to a lost my microphone. Right. We don't have many people. There's not very many competitors out there that do that. So cool. Right. I guess we've touched on most of this. The idea of a paging function, a touch screen, and face plates. The thing with I see, would there not be a, we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen. I'm not sure that's sincerely correct. I think you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that kind of has a portion of the device is not interchangeable. The surrounding questions are interchangeable. We could have the casing. Yeah. The face plates. Okay. Back to the, the costs, the material. We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package. That's something I would say we're including three or four face plates. This can drive the costs up. And the other questions, if we don't include them, are we really in a position to evaluate that market? We haven't done any tests on face plates. Whether, see if there's even interest out there. Okay. I have to talk my head. It sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere. Yeah, because it would have to, who all, it's not like with cell phones like we have a, you know, a Nokia model X. And then 10 people make face plates for it. Yeah. We just are a model of remote control. One of the publicity of a face phone on a phone is you have it out and around. And you have to sort of emblematic whereas you're just sitting at home. So unless somebody comes over to watch TV. Yeah. Well, hopefully some people have people coming over to watch. True. Most people have their televisions in the living room. All right. Well, we can, we can discuss that one further when we think about whether, when we do costs and so forth. True, plastic is dead cheap. And if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway. We'll cross-apparage later. But yeah, we will have to evaluate what's most important. I think we've had a bit of discussion already on these things. Any other questions, comments that came up in these presentations? Well, have we confirmed that we're going to go ahead with a top screen? Yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, I think that would be best. Let's based on what you guys have all said to me. Let's go for a plastic built or a plastic case. Because that this is easy on the cost. Try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended. That's a great idea. With a touch screen for the basic functions. And we'll, yeah, provisionally let's go for a touch screen. We're with several sub menus for possible extra stuff that want to basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen. Do we have, wait a minute, it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen, people are going to have to recharge their remote controls. Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost. So it would have a docking base. Then again, that costs as well. So it's new with the last 20 years, even with the touch screen. Do they? Okay. Give me a 4x and crew line. And we'll somebody buy it if we tell the day. Well, I don't think yeah, I can't see anybody buying a remote control that we have to plug in. So we have to see some kind of new battery technology. Okay. So let's go with a touch screen. With some kind of, you know, with some cutting edge battery technology. For 12 year olds. Yeah, well, hey, you know, it's worth looking into. If not, we can always default to just doing a well presented plastic simple. You know, well, yeah, I mean, you can put that we could add or know. I mean, I suppose we could put the basics on the center easiest, you know, you know, people know the channel volume function. Make them large and easy to get at. And then the other, the other bits and bobs, you know, go through many. We'll do the aesthetics. Okay. So look for the touchscreen in the battery. Focus on presentation. With this voice recognition option as well. Just for the simple functions, the on off channels volume. Great. And a small paging function, even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging, you know, just some kind of simple button that's just, I guess, another infrared signal to the remote control and well to emit some kind of paging. Okay. Right. So any comments? Thoughts before we break into going to the next round of individual work on this. Since we're doing touchscreen, we want to look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the, you know, the actual interface part of it. Things like that. Or is it just going to be one touchscreen for everybody? Interesting. What would be on that touchscreen? Because you said earlier that we have to think about company colors and logo or something or model. I can't exactly say. We put fashion to the electronics. It's my understanding that if you're going to do a skin, you need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control. Yeah, I think perhaps it's too much. Good idea. But yeah, I think that that one might just be. Yeah, I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular. A pda would make a lot of sense for a pda because you're going to be using it to connect up to things anyway. I don't know what you guys think. I think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touchscreen. Yeah, okay. I'm in agreement with that. I'm wondering how we're going to get to, we put fashion into electronics. But if we're going to use a touchscreen where it's going to come on, like on your cell phone, it'll have your, your carrier provider name come up first like well, it's loading and then it goes away. Perhaps it can be like a temporary. It comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it because it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back. Yeah, true. Yeah, I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a second as a trick. Yeah, yeah, no, it seems like it would suffice to just have the RR on there. Yeah, you would think, but. But apparently not. People are going to want their remote to boot up and see flashing things. I just want to be on ready to go. Well, fair enough. Any of that would help the battery life to you if the remote, they do have to press about it for their month to turn on. Then again, who wants to turn on or look at all? Well, you have to do this touch screen and it automatically. It'll wake up. Okay, I'll go into it back to the dormant mode. Okay. Yeah, I like that. I like the idea of putting the logo in the boot up screen. Nice. Cool. So any last things before you break? All right, fair enough. Sounds good. I'm going to save the copy of this case you guys need to remind us. I'm going to save a copy of this and the main set. I'll do in a second and put them in the share folder for a later reference. Let's put my files in the share folder. Brilliant. That's fab guys.
