I'm going to go to the other side of the room. Here we go. Welcome everybody. I'm Abigail Claflin. You can call me Abby. You can call me Abby. Let's see. PowerPoint. That's not it. Here we go. This is our kickoff meeting. I think we should all get acquainted. Shall we all introduce ourselves? Hi, I'm Kiyara and the marketing expert. Would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment? Would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about it? I think we'll get around to that. Just introduction. My name is Kiyara and I'm the marketing expert. I forgot. I forgot. I'm the marketing expert. I think we'll get around to that. I forgot to say I'm the project manager but I figured you all need that already. I'm Stephanie and I am the user interface designer. I'm Krista and I'm the industrial designer. Here's our agenda for today. We're going to do some tool training, project plan and discuss. Then close. So our aim is to produce remote control that is original, trendy and user friendly. To do this, we have to... There are certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing. So... Oh, there it is. Functional design, conceptual design and detailed design. So throughout our next couple of meetings, we'll be covering these things. So we're going to try out our whiteboard. If we all draw our favorite animal to sum up the characteristics of that animal. So you want us to draw it and then talk about it or just draw it. Yeah, both of those. Those thoughts? You have to decide to start some of that. Any volunteers? They wouldn't know what they want to draw. I think about it for a second. Does it have to be functional, trendy and user friendly? I don't think so. Okay, I'll draw. Make sure I hold my hand. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. My favorite animal is... Is he? Oops. A dolphin. Yes. It's like playing fiction. I guess it has a fin on top too. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I guess it has a fin on top too. Yeah. Okay. It's my dolphin. So what characteristics do you like about your animal? I like its tail. I think dolphins are really... They're smart and they're cute. And they like swimming. That's cool. They're graceful, yeah, and they're so... Sleek. Yeah, they're sleeping. They look intelligent and I don't know. I guess it's a little like binocular. I'm a man. How intelligent that one looks. Yeah, he doesn't look that smart. I don't know. I think it's cool the... The interaction that... The things that the reasons people seem to like, you know... You know, people are sitting on the beach and being like, oh look, there's dolphins. It's kind of like... But they're, you know, they jump around in the water and they're happy and... They're mammals, but they swim. So nobody else wants to draw their animal. I suppose I can draw an animal. I don't know. Oh, there goes the 10... It's a cat. I don't know. They sleep all day. Easy to draw. Do you want to... I don't know. I have a cat as well. I have a cat as well. But I've got to spell one. I use a spell one. But it's harder to draw. And the pen's writing. Of course. That's right. That's right. It looks good, but anyway. We'll do that. And the main reason is that pretty. I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment and I like the way they run. And I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of study and nice animals. And I like the way they feel sort of under. Under the... I think that's pretty much it. A bit in. These cords. Actually, I haven't thought of anything yet. It's a pig. So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant, strong and furry. What do you think? Yeah? And furry? Yeah. Well, like a cat. Textile. Textile. I love it. Textile. I'm not trying to split it there. You're dragging it. You have a hair. Oh my gosh. This is disastrous. Sorry about that. Okay. Moving on. Our selling price goal is 25 euro. And profit aim is 50 million euro. So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland or in some European country. And we hope to sell this internationally. Sorry, can you just say that what's the...what are our price goals again? Selling price is 25 euro. Profit aim. 50 million euro. How many should we sell them? Any one of my petitions? Two minutes. No. Two minutes. Two minutes. Two minutes. Two minutes. And well, it's a profit. The profit for each is 12,000 euro. It's 12,000 euro. I'll do it for me. This is a profit. So that's a 50%. I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make this slide show. Experience with remote control. So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide. But we would like to see a convenient practical nice remote control. So do we have any initial ideas for how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the buttons that you have? I think one thing is that it should be easy to find. I was thinking that too. I think you should design something that has like a... So you can... Like somehow like... I mean you always know where your TV is. So you should have a call button. I've always wanted that. Yeah. You can push a button to TV. I mean you have it for the portable phone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control. And even I think a little light. Or even a maybe a vibrating thing. I don't know, but because it's usually under the sofa. Yeah. In which case you're going to be... But if it has a sort of signal which isn't under the sun, I don't know if it's expensive. I don't... Yeah, I mean it'd be cool as enough. But like I mean... Just I mean like your phone even just has sound like it can vibrate. It can light up and make noise. I don't know. What if I had something like... Just like a magnet on the back of it. And you could... I mean just to have some place to put it besides like a bass. Yeah. You know like a portable phone has a bass. Yeah. Like just to have a home for it. Yeah. Yeah. Because people just stick it on top of their TV. But the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the TV. Yeah. That's why it's always in the couch. Yeah. I don't know. It seems like that would be hard because you're not going to be lazy anyway. And we should design couches that have the remote control. Yeah, so we're just now couches. Even just to think to attach it to the... You know, if you had a thing, a pretty object to attach to the wall. But that would make it more expensive. But it's only a plastic thing. Yeah. And then something like that. Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose or something? Bigger? Well, it needs to be... Hand. Hand and that. I don't think you need that. Not huge, but... But definitely not. It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it. No, it really can be. Or like a light thing, you know. I don't know. Space ship. Yeah. Or make it mobile so it runs around. It comes. I can't find you. That would be really... I'm sure we could do that for 25 years. I'll help me in the base. Please. Okay. So what do we think this remote control should... Five minutes. Okay. All right. Let's see what we have left. I also think though that... I shouldn't have too many buttons. Because I hate that one. I have too many buttons. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I know it has to have not many functions, but like... I don't know. Just have like 8,000 buttons. You never use half the time. You... What if... Maybe a little fancy, but what if it had like a little screen? So it has less buttons, but it still has all the functions. That would be cool. Like the way a mobile phone does. Yeah. I mean, it just seems like... So you could like... Yeah. Like if you have... I don't know if you have satellite. If you have 100 channels, you can... The way you do on your radio, that you... What do you call it? I don't know. Yeah, but you can program. So you can program like your favorite channels. So like if you had a... Would you have the screen on the thing or would you have it on the tiny transmit in the screen? That's something we could decide. I guess they would go together somehow? I don't know. Because I don't know if it's... I think it's expensive. If you have... If you use the tiny screen, because the tiny is already a screen, then you can sort of have a programming function. Really easy, sort of arrow up and down on the remote. And then use the tiny as a screen. Right. But... I think you can't... I'm kind of sure. Something like not... It's not on the button, but it's telling you what to do. Is that what you mean? Yeah. You see those... You know, people... I think it's like celebrity crooks kind of things. When they have all these things at their house... Their entire house is so electronic. And they have this one master control that... And it's like a handheld that turns on everything sort of control. And it has a screen. And so I think it should be possible to have some kind of screen. It must be expensive though. But like my mobile phones have screened. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. And we have to remember our budget is 12... Yeah. ...1250 for... To actually make the device... Well, I guess it's something that we have to think about. Yeah. And then we have to see how much that would be. Well, some... We can find out probably... Yeah. How it's it. Yeah, and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water... Water resistance. Water resistance. Oh, I was just... But I thought, ah, spot on. Good feel, tactile... Yeah. The tactile feel. Maybe something that doesn't make your hands sweat, Lord. Yeah. That's quite annoying. Maybe just like a simple thing to have a clip on it. Like seeing you clip it to you. Yeah. Like that's another... Yeah. Okay. Oh. We should probably start wrapping up. We've got some initial ideas that we can all look into. And come up with some new ones for the next meeting, which will be in another 30 minutes. Um... So... Yeah. The industrial design... What is it? Yeah. Um, it's going to be looking more into the working design. So I guess you'd be looking at... That's one of the things you discussed about screen. Um, that sort of thing. The... Something... What is the UI? That's me. Yeah, what is it, Sam? Uh, user interface design. So it's going to be... ... more technical. I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical... Like just... The way it looks. The working design is... The structure. Yeah. Yeah. What is technical function? Exactly. I don't know what. Um, I guess you'd have to find out... It says on the email. It does, but I just don't really wrote down what mine worked. Um, it says... What effect should the thing... Should it have? Okay. Yeah, like in working design. Okay. The medium between you and the telly. Yeah, yeah. All right. Now it works. Okay. All right. I'm on task. And the... Emmy, what is this? Marking. Marking. Marking, right. It's working now. So we'll be working on the user requirements. Um... Yeah. Okay. So I guess that wraps it up. I'll see you all in 30 minutes. I just did...
